# splitter - one interface, two specs, two briefs

One job: decide what is digital, what is analog, and exactly what crosses
between them - written down so both nested runs start from the same
answer and `split` can check they do.

You are a fresh-context subagent (P1, or the `split` verb). Files are the
interface. Run scripts through `${CHIP_FLOW_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/skills/chip-flow}/bin/eda
python ${CHIP_FLOW_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/skills/chip-flow}/engine/scripts/<name>.py`;
JSON out, exit 0/1/2. Keep output ASCII. **No web tools.**

## Inputs
- `brief/` - the task's spec, verbatim. The whole brief.
- On a revision: the current `interface.yaml`, `digital_spec.yaml`,
  `analog_spec.yaml`, and the orchestrator's note on what must change.
- `corpus/msde/sensor_counted/` for the file shapes only - never a rung's
  answer for the block you are splitting.

## Outputs (workspace-relative)
- `interface.yaml` - `version: 1`, `signals:`; each entry has `name`,
  `direction` (`a2d` analog drives digital, `d2a` digital drives analog),
  `level` (e.g. `cmos_3v3`), `domain` (the clock domain, or `clk_free`
  for an asynchronous analog output), `width` and `load`. Every field,
  every entry - `check_split.py` refuses an incomplete one.
- `digital_spec.yaml` - `top` plus an `interface:` list carrying the same
  entries, field for field.
- `analog_spec.yaml` - the same, for the analog side, plus `pads:` - a
  list of every analog pin that leaves the chip on a pad (see below).
- On a Tiny Tapeout analog tile, `interface.yaml` also carries
  `ua_pins: {<analog pin>: <k>}`: every analog pad (an output voltage, a
  control voltage like `vctrl`, a bias or reference input like `bias_ref`)
  mapped to pad `ua[k]`, k from 0 with no gaps. A pad is **never** a
  crossing signal: it does not go in `signals:` or in either side spec's
  `interface:` list, because `top_harden` and `precheck` route pads only
  from `ua_pins` and join everything in `signals:` to the digital side.
  The analog brief names each pad as a `.subckt` pin beside the crossing
  signals and the supplies. `corpus/msde/dac_tile/` shows the shape.
- `digital/brief/spec.md` and `analog/brief/spec.md` - the prose brief each
  nested run's own spec-writer starts from: what that side does, its
  crossing signals named exactly as in `interface.yaml`, and the measures
  or requirements the top-level brief puts on it. The digital brief says
  each crossing signal is a top-level port of that name, mapped to a spare
  TT pin so the digital side hardens and releases alone. The analog brief
  says the cell's `.subckt` pins are the crossing signals plus exactly one
  supply (`vdd...`) and one ground (`vss...`/`gnd...`) - `top_harden`
  joins the two sides by those names. When a crossing signal's receiver
  is a standard cell the split puts inside the analog macro (a ladder's
  bit drivers), the analog brief names each one under `## Split devices`
  with a refdes, the exact `gf180mcu_fd_sc_*` cell and why it sits there;
  the analog spec-writer copies that into `split_devices`, the only way
  the analog-designer may add a device its template lacks. A requirement that only
  makes sense across the boundary (a divided frequency, a DAC code to
  voltage) stays at the top, as a cosim measure, not in either brief.

## Protocol
1. Read the brief. List every signal that crosses; for each, decide the
   side that drives it and what the receiver expects (level, domain).
2. The Tiny Tapeout tile is digital at its pins: the analog block is a
   hard macro inside it. Put anything that can be digital on the digital
   side - it is cheaper to verify there. The exception is an analog pin
   the brief takes off chip (a pad, `ua[k]`, an external bias or
   reference, a probed control voltage): that is an analog pad, listed in
   `analog_spec.yaml`'s `pads:` and mapped in `ua_pins`, not a signal.
3. Write the three YAML files together, then the two briefs.
4. Run `gate.py --gate split --skill msde --workspace <ws>` and fix until
   it passes. A failure is always the three files disagreeing; decide which
   one is wrong rather than copying one over the others blindly.

## Hard rules
- Never write RTL, a netlist, a bench or layout code - the nested runs own
  those.
- Never edit anything under `digital/` or `analog/` except the two
  `brief/spec.md` files.
- A signal in one side spec and not in `interface.yaml` is a defect, not a
  convenience.
- An analog pad in `signals:` is a defect `split` fails (`pad_in_signals`),
  and so is a declared pad missing from `ua_pins`
  (`pad_missing_from_ua_pins`).
