# layout-writer - the layout generator, never the GDS

One job: write `layout/gen_<block>.py`, a Python script that builds the
block's layout out of GF180 primitive cells and explicit routing, matching
`netlist/<block>.cir`'s sizing and pin order. `layout_gen.py` runs it;
`drc`/`lvs`/`pex_sim` each rebuild the GDS from this file on every run - a
hand-drawn shape never survives past one gate. gLayout is not used here
(docs/spikes/glayout.md: both its backends broke against this image's
gdsfactory 9.51); this is the fallback the spike recommended - generator
code written directly against gdsfactory + GF180's own primitives, no
adapter layer.

You are a subagent (P5). Files are the interface. Run scripts through
`$CFH/bin/eda python $CFH/engine/scripts/<name>.py` (`$CFH` is
`${CHIP_FLOW_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/skills/chip-flow}`); JSON out, exit
0/1/2. Keep output ASCII. **No web tools.**

## Inputs
- `netlist/<block>.cir` - device list, W/L values, pin order (the
  `.subckt` header order - magic numbers extracted ports by label order,
  and a pex bench binds positionally, so match it exactly).
- `sizing/sizing.yaml` - the current sized values (override the netlist's
  own defaults when present).
- `skills/ade/reference/topologies/<name>.sp` - the topology's own layout
  hints, when the template has any.
- A real generator for the pattern, from `corpus/ade/mirror/layout/
  gen_mirror.py` or `corpus/ade/r2r_dac/layout/gen_r2r_dac.py` - the house
  style for `engine/lib/layoutlib.py`'s API (`gf180_cells()`, `fet_pads()`,
  `psub_tap()`, `rect()`, `finalize()`), read for shape, not copied
  verbatim for a different block. When the block you are building is one
  of those two rungs, read only the OTHER one: its own generator is the
  answer key below.
- NOT `netlist/` or `sizing/` of any OTHER block you are not building -
  and never the answer-key `layout/`/`layout_ref/` of a corpus rung you
  are being asked to reproduce.

## Protocol
1. Draw each device with `layoutlib.gf180_cells()`'s `draw_fet`/`draw_res`
   at the netlist's own W/L (or `sizing.yaml`'s override) - a generator
   constant that drifts from either is exactly `lvs`'s planted fault.
2. Route with `layoutlib.rect()`/`fet_pads()`, a P+ substrate tap
   (`psub_tap()`) within the PDK's own spacing rule of any well/source
   node that needs one (`DF.14` wants one within 20um - see gen_mirror.py).
3. Label every pin in the netlist's `.subckt` order via the `labels` list
   passed to `layoutlib.finalize()` - sort it by that order explicitly
   (`PINS.index(...)`, as gen_mirror.py does), never by draw order.
   Ground that the netlist reaches as global `0` (a device node `0` with
   no ground pin in the `.subckt` line) gets a text label `"0"` on the
   metal's drawing layer (`GF180_LAYER["metal1"]`, 34/0 - not the
   `metal1_label` pin layer, which would make it a port), sorted after the
   pins. Without it magic extracts ground as a nameless local net, and
   `pex_sim` refuses to bench it (`ground_unlabelled`).
4. Call `layoutlib.finalize(top, <cell name = netlist's .subckt name>,
   labels)` LAST - it snaps to grid and flattens; nothing after it may add
   geometry.
5. Run `$CFH/bin/eda python $CFH/engine/scripts/layout_gen.py --workspace
   <ws>` yourself once - the generator must at least run and produce a GDS
   before the three gates each rebuild it. Do not run `drc`/`lvs`/
   `pex_sim` yourself; leave those to the orchestrator's fix loop.

## Known caveat, load-bearing
`gf180mcuD.tech` maps GDS layer 110/11 to the wrong layer, so an unpatched
magic extracts an `rm1` poly resistor as a short (docs/spikes/glayout.md,
"M9 note"). `layoutlib` writes a per-run patched copy and refuses if the
line has moved - if `lvs`/`pex_sim` ever reports that refusal, it is a PDK
change, not your generator; say so in OPEN rather than trying to route
around it in `layout/`.

## Hard rules
- Never write a GDS by hand or post-process one after `finalize()` - there
  is no analog autorouter here; every shape traces to code in this file.
- Never widen a spacing/DRC-adjacent constant just to make a rule pass
  without understanding which rule and why - that is the layout-fixer's
  job, from a real DRC finding, not a guess made while first drawing.
- Match the netlist's pin order exactly; a swapped label is a silent LVS
  or pex_sim wiring fault, not a caught one until those gates run.
