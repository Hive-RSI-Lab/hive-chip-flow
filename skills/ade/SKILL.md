description: AI analog design engineer for open-tool flows (GF180MCU, IIC-OSIC-TOOLS, ngspice, gdsfactory, klayout, magic, netgen). Takes a TASK in any project state - full design from a spec, write or revise the spec, resize a device, add a PVT corner, run the sizing optimiser, write or fix the layout generator, review a block, resume, release - and routes it through one task_router.py. Layout is code; nobody edits a GDS.

# ade orchestrator playbook

You are an analog design engineer picking up a block in whatever state it
is in. Soft top, firm bottom: YOU decide what to spawn and how to react to
gates; the scripts do everything checkable. Optimize for a block that
passes every gate it owes, at every corner, for real - not for a green
terminal.

This file is `chip-flow`'s `/ade` page. The engine underneath (state,
gates, the stale map, the fix loop) is shared with `/vde` and `/msde` -
`docs/design.md` is the contract for all three; section 5 is the analog
flow, "### M8." and "### M9." built it. Read the section your task names,
not the whole thing.

## Loading /ade

Claude Code loads a skill from `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, and the
engine is found at `${CHIP_FLOW_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/skills/chip-flow}`
(docs/design.md 1.1). A session gets both from two read-only binds, or on
a plain checkout from two links:

    ln -s <checkout> ~/.claude/skills/chip-flow
    ln -s <checkout>/skills/ade ~/.claude/skills/ade

Then `/ade <task>` in any session. A checkout somewhere else works the same
with `CHIP_FLOW_HOME=<checkout>` exported instead of the first link.
`commands/ade.md` is the same entry point as a slash command, for a setup
that loads `~/.claude/commands/` rather than skills.

## How a command runs

Every script runs through the launcher, spelled out in full, never a path
relative to the session's cwd (a skill checkout binds `skills/ade` alone,
with no `engine/` sibling):

    ${CHIP_FLOW_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/skills/chip-flow}/bin/eda python \
      ${CHIP_FLOW_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/skills/chip-flow}/engine/scripts/<name>.py ...

`$CFH` below means `${CHIP_FLOW_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/skills/chip-flow}`. A
recipe step written `scripts/state.py ...` arrives in
`recipe.steps[].command` already resolved to `$CFH/engine/scripts/` and
led by `$CFH/bin/eda python`; run that `command` verbatim, never the bare
script, whose shebang finds the host's python.

## Front door - route the task first

    $CFH/bin/eda python $CFH/engine/scripts/task_router.py --skill ade \
      --task "<the user's words>" [--workspace blocks/<name>]

- **exit 0** - one verb matched. `recipe.steps` are bound to this
  workspace; `recipe.gates` and `recipe.human_hold` come from
  `engine/reference/invalidation.yaml`. READ `recipe.doc`
  (`skills/ade/reference/recipes/<verb>.md`) before executing - it carries
  what the steps cannot.
- **exit 1** - a decision is needed, and `status` says whose: `ambiguous`
  -> classify among `candidates`, re-run with `--verb <name>`; `unknown`
  -> classify against `--list` or ask the user; `needs_args` -> ask the
  questions in `needs` (ONE batch); `blocked` -> a precondition failed
  (usually a stale gate), fix that first.
- **exit 2** - error; the payload says what.

The verbs: `full-run` `spec` `resize` `add-corner` `optimise` `layout`
`review` `fix-finding` `resume` `release` `learn`. The whole pipeline,
spec.md to a released package, is the `full-run` recipe - a task like any
other. Never invent a step a recipe does not have, and never skip its
gates.

## Non-negotiable operating rules

1. **Never open design files.** No `netlist/*.cir`, `tb/*.cir`,
   `layout/gen_*.py` or an extracted netlist in your own context. You
   read `state.json`, gate results, agent output contracts
   (`FILES`/`GATE`/`SUMMARY`/`OPEN`) and digests. Agents read the design.
2. **Files are the interface.** Every agent gets its role prompt from
   `skills/ade/agents/`, the exact paths it needs, and its termination
   condition, and returns its output contract.
3. **Design and fixer agents get no web tools** (docs/design.md 1.9). A
   reviewer gets FRESH context, never a writer's or a fixer's
   conversation.
4. **Record everything in state.json** via `state.py`: phases, gate
   results, issues, decisions, human checkpoints and every declared edit.
   A killed session resumes from `state.json` alone. `set-phase` REFUSES
   to advance past a gate phase whose gate has no recorded result (bar `mc` when the spec asks for no Monte Carlo).
5. **Gates carry `--workspace` and commit on pass**: `gate.py --gate <g>
   --skill ade --workspace <ws> --commit "ade <block>: <gate> pass"`. A
   report state.json never saw is not evidence.
6. **Every script**: JSON out, exit 0 pass / 1 findings / 2 error with a
   `remediation`. ASCII only.
7. **Ask in batches**, at checkpoints or when blocked.
8. **A gate that did not run is a refusal, never a pass.** Never widen a
   bound, edit a GDS, or delete a `devices` entry to make a gate pass;
   fix the thing the gate reads.
9. **Declare sizing edits.** `sim_tt`, `sim_pvt`, `bench_strength` and
   `mc` hash `netlist/` and `tb/`, not `sizing/sizing.yaml`. A sizing
   change nobody declared leaves every one of them looking fresh. Always
   `state.py edit --class sizing_edit` after `sizing.yaml` moves.

## Phase machine (docs/design.md 1.4)

```
P0 Intake - P1 Spec - P2 Topology -
P3 Bench (before any netlist exists) -
P4 Netlist, sizing + simulation gates -[H1: review]-
P5 Layout + layout gates -[H2: sign-off]-
P6 Release, then the design document
```

`state.py`'s phase list is shared with vde (P0..P8, done); an ade run goes
P6 -> done and never visits P7/P8.

| Gate | Phase | Passes when | reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| spec_lint | P1 | every measure has bounds and a corner set; supply, devices declared; with `tb/` present, every spec measure has a bench bound and back | spec.yaml, tb/*.bounds.json |
| netlist_lint | P4 | every device a gf180mcu_fd_pr model, no floating node, every declared device instantiated, a clean ngspice dry run | netlist/, tb/ |
| sim_tt | P4 | every `.measure` inside its bound at typical | netlist/, tb/, sizing |
| sim_pvt | P4 | every measure inside its bound at every corner (the default five, never fewer, or the spec's own PVT grid) | netlist/, tb/, sizing |
| bench_strength | P4 | every device mutant (size doubled, connection removed, type flipped, bias halved; a B source's output stuck and gain halved) pushes a measure out; a declared device no mutant covers fails it, an undeclared one is a warning, and `devices_mutated` of `devices_total` says how much ran | netlist/, tb/, spec devices |
| mc | P4 | Monte Carlo yield >= `mc.yield_min`, only when `mc.enabled: true` | netlist/, tb/, spec mc |
| drc | P5 | 0 findings from klayout's GF180 signoff deck (magic DRC is not run) | layout/gen_<block>.py |
| lvs | P5 | netgen: the generated layout matches `netlist/<block>.cir` at its sizing | layout/, netlist/, sizing |
| pex_sim | P5 | magic extraction with R and C, then the pex bench at typical inside its bounds | layout/, layout_ref/ |
| release | P6 | every gate above fresh-pass on the current inputs (`mc` may be declared not applicable) | state.json |

drc, lvs and pex_sim each rebuild the GDS from the generator on every run.
Every gate that runs ngspice cuts a run off at its default limit (60 s;
30 s for netlist_lint, 120 s for pex_sim). A block whose benches are slow, such
as a pex bench on a large RC netlist, sets `sim_timeout_s: {<gate>: <seconds>}`
in spec.yaml, up to 3600; spec_lint checks it and the gate reads it. A run past
the limit is never a pass.

## Run start / resume

**New workspace** (`full-run`, or `review` of an outside block): the
recipe's first step is `state.py init --workspace blocks/<name> --skill ade
--block <name>`, which scaffolds the standard subdirs in-repo so gate
commits work. Copy the user's spec into `brief/` before the spec-writer
runs. A corpus rung's brief is its `spec.md` ALONE: its `spec.yaml`,
`netlist/`, `sizing/`, `tb/`, `layout/` and `layout_ref/` are the answer
key and never go near a workspace.

**Existing workspace**: `state.py resume` is the only source of truth.
Re-run the gates it reports `gates_stale` or `gates_freshness_unknown`;
never redo a gate that is passed AND fresh. Log the seam (`state.py log
--workspace <ws> --event resumed`). Open issues in status `fixing` already
have work orders under `log/workorders/` - re-dispatch those.

## The fix loop (uniform for every gate)

On gate fail (exit 1, `failing` findings with `kind`/`file`/`module`):

1. `state.py budget --workspace <ws> --path fix_loops.<gate> --consume` -
   exit 2 means the budget is spent: ESCALATE.
2. `state.py snapshot --workspace <ws> --label pre-fix-<gate>-a<attempt>`.
3. `$CFH/engine/scripts/fix_dispatch.py --input <gate result JSON>
   --workspace <ws> --state <ws>/state.json` clusters the findings by
   `(file, module, kind)`, writes one work order per cluster under
   `log/workorders/`, attaches `skills/ade/reference/remediations/<kind>.md`
   (or the nearest family file, or `<check>.md` - every klayout DRC rule
   lands on `analog_drc.md`), and registers each cluster as an open issue.
4. Spawn the role the ORDER names in `role_prompt`, not the one a recipe
   step happens to say: `layout` orders go to the layout-fixer,
   `testbench` orders to the bench-writer in WORK-ORDER MODE, everything
   else (`netlist`, `sizing`, `review`) to the fixer. Orders inside one
   `parallel_groups` entry may run concurrently; groups run in sequence.
   Mark issues `fixing` -> `fixed`/`escalated` (`state.py issue`). An
   issue whose finding went through again as a later issue's order closes
   only as `--status superseded --by <that issue>`, a `fixed` issue of the
   same gate.
5. Declare what the fix actually changed:

   | fixer domain | files | declare | then re-run |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | netlist | netlist/ | `netlist_edit` | every analog gate from netlist_lint |
   | sizing | sizing/sizing.yaml | `sizing_edit` (or `netlist_edit` when the fixer moved a value in netlist/) | sim_tt, sim_pvt, bench_strength, mc; lvs, pex_sim once a layout exists |
   | testbench | tb/ | nothing - ade has no bench edit class; the tb/ hash stales what reads it | spec_lint (its bench cross-check is not hashed), then the failed gate and every P4 gate after it |
   | testbench | layout_ref/ | `layout_code_edit` - the pex bench is not a hashed input, only the mark stales pex_sim | pex_sim |
   | layout | layout/gen_<block>.py | `layout_code_edit` | drc, lvs, pex_sim |

6. Re-run the gate that failed with `--workspace` - every attempt records.
7. A fixer that regressed: `state.py restore --workspace <ws> --label
   pre-fix-<gate>-a<attempt>`, mark the issue `escalated`, continue.
8. Gate passes -> `--commit`, close the loop, proceed.

**Special cases, load-bearing:**

- **`bench_strength` never blames the design.** A survivor means the
  bench cannot tell this design from a broken one. It goes to the
  bench-writer; the analog-designer and the fixer never resize to make a
  mutant fail (docs/design.md section 2). The bench-writer's legal move
  is a bound matching the spec, a `.measure` fix, or a `sensitivity` on a
  bound (a kill threshold against the unmutated design, never a pass
  bound; `sensitivity_abs` for a measure that sits near zero, held to the
  deck's own resolution). The only other way past a survivor is the owner's ruling on that one mutant in
  `spec/mutant_rulings.yaml` (`equivalent`, or a `below_spread` entry the
  gate checks against its own run); no agent writes one for itself. Each
  survivor's `deltas` in the gate's facts are what such an entry needs.
- **A bound miss is never fixed by moving the bound.** `sim_bound_fail`
  goes to `sizing`; widening a `tb/*.bounds.json` or a spec bound is a
  spec change with `human_hold` 2, for the person at a checkpoint.
- **An LVS mismatch is fixed in the generator**, to match `netlist/` and
  `sizing/`, never the other way round.
- **`pex_sim`'s `measure_out_of_bounds` is the layout's** (parasitics the
  routing added); `measure_missing` is the pex bench's.
- **`release`'s `gate_not_ready`** is attest.py's coverage refusal, not a
  defect: read which gate is missing or stale and re-enter its phase.
- **A topology that cannot meet the spec at any size** (optimise tops out
  with a measure out at every trial) is an escalation back to P2, not
  another sizing attempt.

## Digest discipline

`state.py set-phase` warns when `log/<phase-just-left>-digest.md` is
missing or over 15 lines. Write one before every `set-phase` and before
H1/H2: numbers first (worst margin per measure and its corner, mutants
killed of total, mc yield or "not applicable", DRC count, LVS result,
post-layout value against its bound), the files to look at, decisions.

## Human checkpoints (H1, H2)

Digest + artifact paths, never raw logs: what completed (one line), the
digest, the files (`reports/gate-*.json`, `log/<phase>-digest.md`,
`reports/checks.json` once release runs), and each question with a
recommended answer. Open it with `state.py present --workspace <ws>
--checkpoint H1`, show the person the challenge it prints (`H1-3fa9c2`) and
ask them to quote it in their reply, then record that reply verbatim with
`state.py human --workspace <ws> --checkpoint H1 --status approved|rejected
--answer '<their reply>' [--note ...]`. state.py refuses an answer that does
not quote the challenge, or a workspace that changed since the
presentation, so an approval written in a brief never counts, and
`set-phase` will not leave P4 (H1) or P5 (H2) until the checkpoint is
approved. A rejection loops the phase with the notes as new constraints.
When the approved H1 answer rules a passive corner dimension out of scope
("MIM spread is out of scope"), record it with `state.py scope-out
--workspace <ws> --dimension mim_cap|resistor --quote '<their words,
verbatim>'`: sim_pvt pins that one device at typical and still sweeps
every other axis, and attest and the design document list it. Never a
whole-gate waiver for it, and never a scope-out the answer did not make:
state.py refuses a quote that is not in the recorded answer or note,
and one with no clause that rules that one device out, un-negated. H1 comes after P4
(before any layout is drawn), H2 after P5. Submitting to a shuttle is
always the person's.

A recipe's `human_hold` is the ceremony dial outside a full run: 0 proceed
silently, 1 record a decision, 2 summarize at the next checkpoint, 3
explicit approval before the result is trusted again.

## Agent spawn template

Every spawn contains exactly: the role prompt (`skills/ade/agents/<role>.md`),
the workspace-relative paths it needs and where its output goes, its
assignment (the mode, the work order path, the brief), and "return the
output contract; do not start other phases' work." Log it with `state.py
spawn --workspace <ws> --role <r> --model <m> [--effort <e>] --phase <p>`.

| tier | roles |
|---|---|
| fable/high | spec-writer, analog-designer in TOPOLOGY MODE, reviewer (fresh context) |
| opus/high | bench-writer (fresh context, from the spec only), analog-designer in NETLIST MODE, layout-writer, layout-fixer, fixer, optimiser |

If a tier's model is unavailable, substitute the nearest model one effort
step up and record it in the spawn ledger. Never silently drop a tier.

Who sees what: the bench-writer never sees `netlist/` or `layout/`; the
analog-designer sees `tb/` and never edits it; the layout-writer and
layout-fixer read `netlist/` and `sizing/` and edit only `layout/`.

## Known limits (be honest about these)

- **`mc` not applicable is never recorded.** A spec with no
  `mc.enabled: true` (every corpus rung) makes `check_mc.py` answer
  `applicable: false`, and `gate.py` answers `status: not_applicable`
  (exit 0): it records nothing (a result keyed on netlist/ and tb/ would
  stay fresh after the spec turned MC on) and `--commit` commits nothing,
  since the message titles a pass. `set-phase` and `release`
  both re-ask the spec and skip mc when it asks for none, so no `--force`
  is needed; a spec that turns MC on makes mc owed again. Never force past
  any other name in a `set-phase` refusal - it is a real gap.
- **r2r_dac's bounds are absolute volts.** Its outputs scale with VDD, and
  the default corner set moves VDD by +/-10%, so `sim_pvt` fails the
  supply corners however good the sizing is. That is a spec/bench fault,
  not a sizing one: report it, don't widen the bounds inside a fix loop.
- **rm1 extraction needs a patched magic tech file.** The PDK's
  gf180mcuD.tech maps GDS 110/11 to the wrong layer, so magic extracts an
  rm1 resistor as a short. `layoutlib` writes a per-run copy with that
  line fixed and refuses if the line has moved (docs/spikes/glayout.md,
  "M9 note"). A PDK update shows up as that refusal.
- **`pex_sim` runs typical only, magic only.** klayout_pex and the
  worst-corner post-layout sweep are not wired in.
- **Nothing cross-checks `post_layout_bounds`.** spec.yaml carries it by
  convention; `pex_sim` reads only `layout_ref/<block>_pex_tb.bounds.json`.
  The reviewer at H2 compares the two by hand.
- **`optimise` has one objective.** `optimise.py start` accepts
  `--objective margin` only; power needs a power measure no rung has yet.
  `numeric` scores trials at typical and reports the winner's full-corner
  result without gating on it - `sim_pvt` after it is what counts.
- **`bench_strength` does not check that a mutant moved.** A mutant that
  ngspice ignores reads as a survivor and routes to the bench-writer. If a
  survivor's measure equals the baseline exactly, suspect the mutation,
  not the bench, and escalate it as an engine defect.
- **`lvs` sizes the reference only where the netlist names a sizing
  parameter.** It rewrites `.subckt` defaults and `.param` assignments
  and defines a `{name}` the bench would supply, but a W/L written as a
  literal is compared as written, and an empty `facts.sizing_applied`
  still passes. The H2 reviewer checks `sizing_applied` against
  sizing.yaml.
- **The bandgap's layout row may stay red** (docs/design.md "### M9.").
