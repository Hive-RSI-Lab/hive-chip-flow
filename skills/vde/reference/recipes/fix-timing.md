# fix-timing - a timing fix invalidates the hardened netlist, not just the number

`timing` reads OpenSTA's report on the HARDENED netlist, at LibreLane's own
corners. This verb exists because the generic `fix-finding` loop, applied
naively to a `timing` failure, would re-run `timing` again right after the
fix - against a netlist the fix never actually touched. A
`harden/config.override.json` edit, or an RTL restructure, only takes effect once
`harden` regenerates the netlist; `fix-timing` re-hardens before
re-checking, `fix-finding` does not know to.

## Which edit class

The fixer's actual domain decides, and you supply it explicitly
(`--arg edit_class=rtl_edit` or `--arg edit_class=harden_config_edit`) -
this verb does not guess:

- The fix was a LibreLane setting (resizer, placement, CTS keys) written to
  `harden/config.override.json` -> `harden_config_edit` (marks `harden`
  onward stale). The override is a JSON object merged last into the
  `harden/config.json` harden regenerates on every run, so edit the
  override, never `config.json` or `info.yaml` - those edits are lost.
  CLOCK_PERIOD, tile/PDK keys and the template's DO-NOT-CHANGE keys are
  refused (exit 2).
- The fix was an RTL restructure (retiming, pipelining, a path that needed
  restructuring, not just re-constraining) -> `rtl_edit` (marks
  everything from `lint` onward stale - a bigger cascade, correctly, since
  the design's own text moved).

## Why re-harden is not optional here

Skipping straight to `gate: timing` after either edit would evaluate
`timing` against the OLD hardened netlist - a stale pass (or a stale,
misleading fail) either way. The recipe always re-runs `harden` (job,
polled) before re-checking `timing`, even when the edit class is
`rtl_edit` and RTL's own `lint`/`sim`/`mutate`/`formal`/`cover`/`synth`
gates need their own separate re-run too (the fix loop handles those the
normal way; this verb only owns the harden-then-timing sequence).
