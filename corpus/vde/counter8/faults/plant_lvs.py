"""Fault: one net split in two in LibreLane's extracted layout netlist, the
electrical effect of a missing via (gates.yaml's lvs row, docs/design.md
"### M4."). It edits final/spice/, not the GDS. Hardens the untouched RTL first (`lvs` reads harden's own
output on disk, not anything faults.py records, so this fault runs
check_harden.run() itself before the target gate sees it).

check_lvs.py's own docstring explains why this corrupts the extracted
netlist TEXT rather than the GDS geometry directly: a from-scratch
`extract all` on a hand-edited GDS was tried first here and does not
reproduce LibreLane's own pin naming/property setup closely enough to
match even the clean design, so check_lvs.py compares against LibreLane's
OWN extraction (`final/spice/*.spice`) instead - meaning a fault has to
land there too, or it would never be seen by the comparison this gate
actually runs. Splitting one internal net name into two, at exactly one of
its occurrences, has the same electrical effect a missing via would: the
two device terminals that used to share a node no longer do."""
