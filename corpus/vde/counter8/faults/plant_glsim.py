"""Fault: glsim's own row (docs/design.md 1.5 "### M4.") names a register
read before it is written, an X-propagation race - genuinely reproducing
one needs a path whose real, SDF-annotated gate delay exceeds the
testbench's own clock period while staying invisible at zero delay; two
attempts at that during this milestone (a linear XOR-rotate chain, then a
200-bit ripple-carry add) were both optimised into a handful of gates by
yosys/ABC and left comfortable timing margin either way - not something
this milestone's time budget could chase further by trial and error.

What this fault demonstrates instead, honestly: the SAME functional bug
plant_sim.py uses for the `sim` gate (docs/design.md "### M2."), reached
through glsim's own pipeline - the gate-level netlist, the generated
tt_pins harness, both cocotb passes - to prove that pipeline catches a
real defect end to end, not only that it can be made to fail somehow. A
genuinely gate-level-only race is future work, noted here rather than
faked. plant_glsim_sdf.py is the fault only the SDF pass catches."""
