"""gen_comparator.py - layout generator for the ade/comparator corpus rung
(docs/design.md 5, "### M9."; docs/spikes/glayout.md's fallback).

Draws netlist/comparator.cir's `strongarm_comparator`: five NFETs and six
PFETs, all at L=0.28u, pins inp/inn/clk/outp/outn/vdd/vss. The widths are
this generator's own constants, typed in by the layout-writer from
sizing/sizing.yaml; LVS is what checks them against the netlist.

Two things decide this floorplan, and the post-layout bench measures both.

Symmetry. A StrongARM latch turns any capacitance difference between its
two halves into input offset, and the bench decides on 1 mV. An earlier
draft, which crossed outp and outn over the whole row in channels of
different depth, extracted 0.35 fF more on outn than on outp and decided
the same way whatever the input, up to about 5 mV of it. Here every device
of one half has its twin at the mirrored x in the other (xmip/xmin,
xmln1/xmln2, xmlp1/xmlp2, xmrp/xmrn, xmron/xmrop), pad nets mirrored, and
the one place outp and outn must cross (the latch's cross-coupling) is two
short metal2 tracks, twisted on the axis so that each output runs half
its length on the track beside the NFET row and half on the one beside
the PFET row's nwell.

Short outputs. Every fF on outp/outn slows the regeneration the bench's
decision delay measures. Each latch inverter is one column, its NFET under
its PFET: a straight metal1 strip joins their drains (the output) and
another their gates, so the cross-coupling is two tracks between the two
latch columns and nothing of an output leaves the middle of the cell.

  top channel     clk, vdd (metal2)           PFET gate_top pads up to clk
  PFET row        xmrp xmlp1 xmron | xmrop xmlp2 xmrn, one nwell, an N+
                  tap (vdd) at each end; xmlp1-xmron and xmron-xmrop
                  joined in the row (outn, vdd)
  middle channel  the latch columns' drain and gate strips, the dp/dn
                  drain strips, and the outp/outn cross-coupling tracks
  NFET row        xmip xmln1 | xmln2 xmin, top-aligned, dp/dn joined in
                  the row, a P+ tap (vss) at each end
  tail channel    tail (metal2)               input pair sources down to it
  tail row        xmtail, alone on the axis
  bottom channel  clk, vss (metal2)           xmtail's gate and source
  inp and inn run straight down from their gates to pins of their own; a
  metal1 column beyond each end joins the two clk tracks.

A pad stub keeps the outer 0.30um of its pad, so it clears the unused gate
pad by more than M1.2a's 0.23um.
