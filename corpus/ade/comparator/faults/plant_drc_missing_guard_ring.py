"""plant_drc_missing_guard_ring.py - ade/comparator `drc` fault: removes the
P+ substrate taps at both ends of the NFET row and leaves the vss routing
in place - a real "missing guard ring", no substrate tap near any NMOS.
Both go, because the cell is narrower than the rule's reach and either tap
alone still covers every NFET. klayout's GF180 signoff deck reports it as
DF.14 (a substrate tap within 20um of NCOMP).
