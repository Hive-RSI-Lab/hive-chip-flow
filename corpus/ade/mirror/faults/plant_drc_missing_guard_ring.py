"""plant_drc_missing_guard_ring.py - ade/mirror `drc` fault (docs/design.md
1.5, "### M9."): removes the substrate tap placement from
layout/gen_mirror.py, leaving the rest of the VSS routing (both sources and
the bus) intact - a real "missing guard ring": no P+ tap anywhere near
either NMOS. klayout's real GF180 signoff deck catches this as DF.14 ("max
distance of a substrate tap from NCOMP is 20um"); magic's own DRC does not
enforce it at all in this repo's check_analog_drc.py (docs/spikes/glayout.md
already found magic silently hides a DIFFERENT class of bug here - this
fault exercises a distinct rule, but the same "klayout is the DRC that
counts" reasoning is why analog_drc runs klayout only).
