"""plant_drc_offgrid.py - ade/r2r_dac `drc` fault (docs/design.md 1.5,
"### M9."; docs/spikes/glayout.md). Patches layout/gen_r2r_dac.py's own
final `return layoutlib.finalize(...)` line to add one extra shape AFTER
finalize()'s own 5nm grid-snap has already
run - the only way an off-grid shape can survive to the written GDS, since
every generator's own geometry goes through that snap. Placed far from any
real geometry (x=20), and 0.6um square so it clears metal1's minimum
width and area: ONLY klayout's own *_OFFGRID rule fires, not a width,
area or spacing rule - reproducing docs/spikes/glayout.md's own finding that this
class of bug is invisible to magic (which silently re-snaps on load) and
caught only by klayout's real GF180 deck.
