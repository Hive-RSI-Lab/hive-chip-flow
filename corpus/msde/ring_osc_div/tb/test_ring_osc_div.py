"""The cosim bench for ring_osc_div (docs/design.md 1.5 msde table's
`cosim` row, "### M10."). Drives ring5.sp (a real SPICE feedback
oscillator) through cocotbext-ams's MixedSignalBridge, lets the real
divide-by-2 flip-flop (ring_osc_div_top.v) react to the forced waveform,
and records what it measured to reports/cosim_measures.json BEFORE any
assertion that could raise - engine/scripts/check_cosim.py is the gate's
own authority on pass/fail (it parses this file and the raw sim log
independently of whatever this test asserts), but a bench that cannot even
write a measures file is itself the strongest signal something upstream
never ran.
