# docs/spikes/dcosim/run.sh -- M10 spike: does ngspice's d_cosim/ivlng
# bridge work in this box's image? Section 1 reproduces the answer (no,
# with the exact evidence). Section 2 runs the first fallback from
# design.md section 5 (cocotbext-ams, already in the image) end to end
# and checks the digital side really drove the analog computation. Section
# 3 (M10) is the spike's open issue, partly resolved: the same gf180
# transistor-level two-inverter pair, through cocotbext-ams, round-trips a
# real digitized transition (asserted, not exit 0) - the original ".ic on
# the wrong node name" bug is genuinely fixed - but the same run's tran
# then hits a separate shared-library timestep quirk and aborts at its own
# declared end (dcosim.md's "Resolved for M10" section has the honest
# story). This section fails on that signature rather than reporting PASS
# on cocotb's own clean exit alone.
#
# Everything runs through bin/eda; nothing is written under the toolchain.
