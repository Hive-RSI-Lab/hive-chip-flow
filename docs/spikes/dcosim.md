# dcosim spike (M10): does ngspice's d_cosim/ivlng bridge work?

## Verdict

**No — d_cosim's `simulation="ivlng"` backend is broken in this image, and
is not fixable without writing into the read-only toolchain tree.**
M10 should build `cosim` on the first working fallback from design.md
section 5: **cocotbext-ams**, which this image already ships and which
turns out to itself be an implementation of section 5's second fallback
too (a lock-step driver of ngspice's shared library) — so there is only
one fallback to pick, not two.

Open item this spike left: a real gf180 transistor-level two-inverter block
did not converge inside that bridge (below). Partly resolved for M10 — see
"Resolved for M10" below: the wrong node name in the `.ic` fix was real and
is genuinely fixed, so the pair now round-trips a real digitized transition
through the bridge. A separate, narrower shared-library timestep quirk
remains open, not fixed — the same run's `tran` then aborts at its own
declared end. `run.sh` section 3 fails on that signature rather than
reporting a false pass on cocotb's own clean exit.

## Why ivlng is broken

`ivlng.so`/`ivlng.vpi` exist at
`$T/foss/tools/ngspice/lib/ngspice/`. Two problems, both hardcoded
absolute `/foss/...` paths baked into compiled binaries at image build
time, from before the tree was relocated under `~/.cc/toolchains`:

1. ngspice's own `spinit` (found via `SPICE_LIB_DIR`) hardcodes
   `codemodel /foss/tools/ngspice/lib/ngspice/*.cm` — worked around with a
   corrected local `spinit` pointing at `$T`'s real paths (see `run.sh`).
2. `d_cosim`'s `simulation="ivlng"` keyword itself resolves to the
   hardcoded path `/foss/tools/ngspice/lib/ngspice/ivlng.so` — worked
   around by passing ivlng's real, absolute path instead of the keyword.
3. But `ivlng.so`'s *own* `dlopen()` of `libvvp.so` is **also** hardcoded
   to `/foss/tools/ngspice/lib/ngspice/libvvp.so` — a file that was never
   there; the real one is under `iverilog/lib/`. This is a `dlopen()` of a
   literal compiled-in string, so no env var reaches it. An LD_PRELOAD
   interposer was tried (same trick `bin/eda` uses for yosys's
   `/proc/self/exe`); it failed because `digital.cm` binds the *versioned*
   symbol `dlopen@GLIBC_2.34`, which a plain preload does not intercept.
   Fixing this needs either a symbol-versioned interposer (real effort,
   not attempted further) or a write into the read-only image — out of
   bounds. Confirmed broken, not merely unconfigured.

## The fallback: cocotbext-ams

`eda python3 -c "import cocotbext.ams"` succeeds. It wraps `libngspice.so`
via `ctypes` and lets a normal cocotb testbench drive/read an
`AnalogBlock` (a `.subckt` in a SPICE file) through `MixedSignalBridge`,
event-driven, no Icarus-inside-ngspice involved at all.

`docs/spikes/dcosim/run.sh` runs both halves. The working example: a
digital stub (`two_inv_stub.v`) with cocotb driving `in_pin`, wired to an
ideal two-stage inverting SPICE block (`two_inv.sp`, behavioral E-sources
— numerically well-posed, used to isolate the bridge itself from
transistor convergence). Result, three separate transitions each with a
real ngspice transient in between:

```
40.00ns  in_pin=0 -> out_pin=0
120.00ns in_pin=1 -> out_pin=1
180.00ns in_pin=0 -> out_pin=0
TESTS=1 PASS=1 FAIL=0
```

Each readback comes from cocotb re-reading a digitized ngspice node
voltage after a real transient segment, not a wire — proven separately by
first running a passive R-divider block, which read back a threshold-
dependent value rather than a trivial passthrough.

A real gf180 transistor-level pair is in `two_inv_gf180.sp`. Under this
same bridge (`uic`-started transient, `external` sources) it aborts
around t=5-10ns, before the first input change, with `Timestep too small
... trouble with node "v_vss#branch"`, insensitive to `gmin`/`itl4`
stepping, RC input damping, and correct `.ic` values — a real ngspice
convergence issue with the bridge's cold `uic` start on active devices,
left as an M10 follow-up rather than solved here.

## Resolved for M10

The "correct `.ic` values" above were never actually applied. `mid` is an
internal node of `two_inv_gf180.sp`'s `.subckt` — not a port — and
cocotbext-ams's generated wrapper netlist always instantiates the user
subcircuit as `x1`, so the node's real top-level name is `x1.mid`. ngspice
does not error on an `.ic` naming a node that does not exist; it prints
"IC on non-existent node - mid, ignored" and carries on, so the fix looked
like a no-op rather than a wrong name.

With `.ic v(x1.mid)=<expected> v(out_pin)=<expected>` passed through
`AnalogBlock`'s `extra_lines` (alongside the PDK's own `design.spice` and
`sm141064.spice typical` includes), the identical netlist converges
cleanly under plain batch `ngspice -b` for a full window with real digital
transitions. Through cocotbext-ams itself, the pair round-trips both
digital-driven transitions and the digitized readback is asserted (not
exit 0) — genuinely fixed, not a no-op — **but** the same run's `tran` then
hits the second, narrower quirk below and aborts at its own declared end
(`time = 5e-08` — exactly `duration_ns=50.0` — logged as "Timestep too
small ... trouble with node x1.mid" followed by "tran simulation(s)
aborted"). `docs/spikes/dcosim/run.sh` section 3 used to report PASS here
on cocotb's own clean exit alone, missing that log line entirely; it now
scans the sim log for the same signature `check_cosim.py` does and fails
on it.

A second, narrower issue remains and is not a netlist or modeling problem:
this ngspice build's shared-library transient can drive its own adaptive
timestep to numeric underflow whenever it is forced to land exactly on a
boundary time — a periodic fallback sync, or the analysis's own declared
final `tstop` — regardless of the circuit's actual state at that instant
(confirmed by sweeping about twenty different declared stop times on the
identical static, never-toggling netlist: all but one failed, each exactly
at its own declared end; the same netlist run start-to-finish under plain
batch `ngspice -b`, which never needs to land on such a boundary, never
failed once). This is specific to running through the shared library,
which every real cosim bridge must use (batch mode has no bidirectional
channel) — not to gf180, BSIM, or `uic` specifically. **Not actually
worked around**: the idea was that a bench should request more duration
than it needs and let the run finish naturally, but `test_two_inv_gf180.py`
itself requests `duration_ns=50.0` — no more than it needs — and that
exact value is one of the ones that fails. Re-checked 2026-09-24 (~20
minutes, docs/spikes/dcosim/run.sh section 3 item on chip-flow PR #8):
sweeping `duration_ns` over 41.0/42.0/44.0/46.0/50.3 (all failed, each at
its own declared end, matching the pattern above) and 45.0/48.7 (both
converged cleanly, twice each) reproduces the original ~20-value sweep's
finding rather than explaining it — roughly one declared stop time in
three converges here, with no principled rule found for which, so picking
one of the clean values would just be repeating the original "all but one
worked" luck, not fixing it. Left as `duration_ns=50.0` (a value that
fails, on purpose) so `run.sh` keeps reporting the true state instead of a
lucky pass; `check_cosim.py`'s independent sim-log scan is still the real
guard against this in the actual gate (halting a foreground
shared-library `tran` mid-flight was not found to be reliable either —
`bg_halt` targets a `bg_run`-started analysis, not one started with the
plain blocking `tran` command cocotbext-ams's own `run_simulation()`
issues).

M10's own `cosim` gate (`engine/scripts/check_cosim.py`) does not trust a
clean exit for this reason: it parses the raw sim log for ngspice's own
non-convergence signatures independently of what the cocotb regression
reports, on every run.

The `cosim` gate's own bench (`corpus/msde/ring_osc_div`) does not reuse
this gf180 pair — a multi-stage active ring oscillator is a substantially
harder cold-start problem (an unforced symmetric equilibrium, on top of
the same BSIM sensitivity), and gates.yaml's own pass criterion for
`cosim` is a measure inside its bound, not a proof that a gf180 ring
converges. That rung's `ring5.sp` is a real SPICE feedback oscillator built
from ideal RC/comparator stages instead, deliberately avoiding BSIM's
near-zero-leakage cold-start sensitivity while still being genuinely
computed by ngspice — see that rung's own `spec.md` for the reasoning, and
`skills/ade/reference/topologies/` (M8, in flight) for where a real gf180
ring belongs once it exists.

## Reproduce

```
docs/spikes/dcosim/run.sh
```

This spike's own script currently exits 1: section 3 correctly fails on
the shared-library timestep quirk above (`duration_ns=50.0` is one of the
values that does not converge cleanly). That is expected, not a
regression — see "Resolved for M10" for why this is left failing honestly
rather than picking a `duration_ns` that happens to pass.
