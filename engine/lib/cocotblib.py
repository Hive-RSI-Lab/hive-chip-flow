"""cocotblib.py - shared cocotb/Icarus plumbing for the digital gates that
actually simulate (sim, holdout, mutate - docs/design.md "### M2.").

Not named in docs/design.md 1.3's module list - that list ports /hwde's
KiCad-domain modules and names simlib as the ANALOG equivalent (ngspice
benches). Nothing in the design doc covers "build+run a directory of cocotb
tests over Icarus, parse pass/fail, and tell requirement tags apart from
test bodies" - sim, holdout and mutate all need exactly this, so it lives
here once rather than three times.

Requirement tagging convention (this module's own choice; docs/design.md
section 2 says only "every test carries the requirement ids it covers", not
the mechanism): a `# req: ID [ID2 ...]` comment on the line immediately
before a `@cocotb.test()` decorator tags that test with the requirement
id(s) it covers; several such lines stacked above one test (other comment
lines may sit between them) tag it with the union of their ids - UNLESS that decorator carries `expect_fail`/`expect_error`
(see scan_requirement_tags below): a test cocotb itself expects to fail
cannot silently stand in for a real pass.

    regression over Icarus. Returns the results.xml path (results_xml is
    pinned explicitly - concurrent callers, e.g. check_mutate.py running one
    mutant per task, must never share cocotb's own default path).

    log_file=build_dir/sim.log is passed to both build() and test(): without
    it, cocotb_tools.runner's own Simulator._execute runs iverilog/vvp with
    stdout=None, which inherits the CALLER's real stdout fd - the same fd a
    caller several layers up (gate.py --gate sim) later prints its JSON
    report to. Every line of iverilog/vvp/cocotb's own console output would
    land on that fd ahead of the JSON, so a consumer that runs gate.py as a
    subprocess and expects pure JSON on stdout gets unparsable noise instead
    (nothing here breaks: results are already read back from results_xml,
    never from this log).

    Every path handed to cocotb_tools.runner is resolved to absolute FIRST
    (found the hard way, M5): the runner's own Simulator._execute changes
    the real OS working directory before it spawns iverilog/vvp, so a
    caller's RELATIVE `results_xml` (or build_dir/test_dir) is no longer
    relative to the caller's own cwd by the time it is actually opened - it
    lands nested one more copy of the workspace's own relative prefix
    beneath test_dir (e.g. `tb/blocks/x/log/results.xml` instead of
    `blocks/x/log/results.xml`). That silently writes INSIDE `tb/` itself,
    a `dir_text`-hashed gate input, and staled every gate that reads `tb`
    on the very next hash check with no RTL/tb edit involved. Absolute
    paths make every one of these calls independent of whatever directory
    the runner is standing in at the moment it opens them.

    timeout_s, if given, bounds build()+test() together with a SIGALRM
    (Unix - matching bin/eda's own platform assumption; None, the default,
    changes nothing for existing callers). This is the only lever available
    for a co-simulation run: build()/test() call straight into cocotb's own
    Python API and ngspice's shared library, not a subprocess this module
    can attach a `timeout=` kwarg to or kill outright, so a real hang here
    (an ngspice shared-library co-sim wedged waiting on a sync point that
    never comes, say) would otherwise block forever with no exit code to
    time out on. CocotbTimeout propagates to the caller uncaught - check_
    *.py's cli_wrap (checklib.py) maps any exception to exit 2, the same
    "this gate did not run" contract a hang should report.

    waves=True has cocotb dump `<build_dir>/<hdl_toplevel>.fst` (Icarus
    always gets -fst or -none, so never VCD); optimise.py's power metric
    is the one caller, and converts it with `eda fst2vcd`."""
