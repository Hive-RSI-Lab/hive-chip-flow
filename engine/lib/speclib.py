"""speclib.py - spec.yaml parsing and lint rules (docs/design.md 1.4, 1.5).

New at M2 (docs/design.md 1.3: "New: ... speclib ..."): nothing to port, this
is chip-flow's own shape, not /hwde's. spec.yaml is a block's machine-readable
half of its spec, and `spec_lint` (engine/scripts/check_spec_lint.py, gates.yaml
row of the same name) refuses a block without one.

Schema this module reads (docs/design.md 1.4 plus one field the design leaves
implicit: every other gate that names a top module - lint, sim, mutate,
synth, harden - needs one *somewhere*, and spec.yaml, read before any RTL
exists, is the only artifact early enough):

    top: str                    the top module name (new here; 1.4 does not
                                 spell this out, but every later gate needs it
                                 from somewhere, and this is the earliest
                                 artifact that exists)
    requirements:
      - id: str                 unique, non-empty
        text: str                non-empty prose
        check: sim|formal|both|measure
        bounds: {...}            required when check == measure
    ports: {name: {dir, width}} optional, loose
    tt_pins: {name: pin}         optional (M4+); a non-empty mapping when present
    clock: {period_ns, domains, primary?}  optional, loose; primary must
                                 name a domain, and is required by harden
                                 when there is more than one
    must_keep: [str]             optional

Pass criteria (gates.yaml `spec_lint` row): "Every requirement has an id, a
check kind and, for `measure`, bounds; tt_pins fit the tile." The tile-fit
half needs the TT template (M4, engine/reference/tt/) and is out of scope
until then - lint_spec here validates everything that does not need it, and
raises nothing tile-shaped; a tt_pins mapping is required to be a real,
non-empty mapping when present, but never checked against a tile's pin count.

Every violation is checklib.violation()-shaped so check_spec_lint.py can
hand the list straight to checklib.report().
