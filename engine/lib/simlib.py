"""simlib.py - ngspice bench plumbing for the analog engine (docs/design.md
1.3, 1.5, "### M8."): `.bounds.json` sidecars, `.measure` parsing, deck
templating for corners/sizing, and ngspice failure detection.

Ported from /hwde's scripts/lib/simlib.py in BEHAVIOR, not mechanism. hwde
drives ngspice IN-PROCESS through InSpice's shared-library binding
(NgSpiceShared) and never even inspects an exit code - failure there is
bounds-driven only, off measures parsed from ngspice's own stdout and a
`.measure ... failed!` line parsed from stderr (load_bounds/compare_bounds/
parse_measures/parse_failed_measures below are that logic, carried over
near verbatim - the sidecar shape and the two regexes are unchanged).
chip-flow shells out through `eda ngspice -b <deck>` instead (design.md
1.2's launcher; 1.3: "now through `eda ngspice -b`"), which drops the whole
InSpice/DLL layer but ALSO drops the one thing an in-process binding gave
hwde for free: a Python exception on a bad run. CLI batch ngspice hands
back nothing but text and an exit code - and the exit code lies.

Confirmed empirically against this box's real gf180mcuD models, not a
guess (see docs/spikes/dcosim.md for the earlier, related finding under a
different bridge): a MOSFET gate left floating (no DC path to any supply)
drives ngspice through "singular matrix" -> "Dynamic gmin stepping
failed" -> "True gmin stepping failed" -> "source stepping failed" - every
one of those a WARNING on stderr, never an Error - and ngspice still
finishes the requested `.op`, prints v(d) and v(floatgate) as if nothing
happened, and exits 0. A truly unresolvable model name (a real parse-time
error) DOES exit nonzero with an "Error:" line on stderr - but nothing
about the exit code alone lets a caller tell a clean run, a recovered-but-
meaningless run, and a real parse failure apart from each other without
reading the text. ENGINE_ERROR_PATTERNS below is the new safety net this
gate needs that hwde's PCB-level (op-amp/divider/zener) benches never had
to build: gate.py's own contract ("a gate whose tool could not run is exit
2, never a pass") and this milestone's specific brief both require that a
run which errored, failed to converge, or produced a measure it never
printed must fail the sim gate - not merely look clean because ngspice
said so.

Deck templating (materialize, new at M8): a bench/netlist file is plain
SPICE with `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders - `{{PDK}}` (the PDK root, e.g. for a
`.lib '{{PDK}}/libs.tech/ngspice/sm141064.spice' {{CORNER}}` line),
`{{CORNER}}` (an ngspice `.lib` section name from corners.yaml: typical,
ss, ff, sf, fs), `{{RES_CORNER}}`/`{{MIM_CORNER}}` (the PDK's passive
sections, res_<p>/mimcap_<p>, p from corners.passive_of), `{{TEMP_C}}`, `{{VDD}}`, and `{{SIZING}}` (a generated
`.param name=value ...` line built from a block's optional sizing/
sizing.yaml, section 4's optimise target - empty when the block has none).
Double braces are deliberate: ngspice's OWN expression syntax is a single
`{expr}` (e.g. `w={wn}`), so `{{...}}` cannot collide with real SPICE.
