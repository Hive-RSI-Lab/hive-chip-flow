"""layoutlib.py - shared analog-layout helpers for M9 (docs/design.md 1.5,
5, "### M9."; docs/spikes/glayout.md).

New at M9: nothing to port - the spike's own verdict is what this module
implements. gLayout doesn't run on the image's gdsfactory 9.51 (neither
backend is DRC-clean out of the box), so M9 takes the documented fallback:
"generator code written directly against gdsfactory ... with the GF180
PDK's primitive cells." Those primitive cells turn out to already exist,
gdsfactory-native, inside the PDK itself:
`$PDK/libs.tech/klayout/tech/pymacros/cells/{draw_fet,draw_res}.py` (vendor
code, `import gdsfactory as gf`, `@gf.cell`, returns `gf.Component`) - this
is what `gf180_cells()` imports. Verified empirically against the real
klayout GF180 signoff deck (the one docs/spikes/glayout.md says counts,
since magic re-snaps on load and hides off-grid shapes):
`draw_nfet()`/`draw_pfet()` at their own declared defaults are 1 violation
away from clean (DF.14: "max distance of a substrate tap from NCOMP is
20um" - an isolated device with no tap anywhere in range), and
`draw_npolyf_res(w_res>=0.564...)` is clean outright. Both generator
functions' own built-in `lbl=True`/`sd_lbl`/`g_lbl`/`sub_lbl` text-labeling
path is dead on this gdsfactory version (`Component.add_label()` silently
registers nothing `get_labels()` or a GDS re-read can find - the same class
of moved/changed-API break docs/spikes/glayout.md found in gLayout's own
adapter, just smaller) - `add_text_label()` below is the replacement,
writing a real GDS text record straight onto the (unlocked) assembling
Component's own klayout cell.

Every device this module places still needs the "context" a lone PCell
lacks: a P+ substrate tap within DF.14's 20um for any NMOS, wired to the
same ground net a source ties to. `psub_tap()` is that tap, hand-drawn
(no vendor generator for a lone tap was found) and verified clean at >=1.75um
edge clearance from a device.
