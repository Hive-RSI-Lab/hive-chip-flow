"""sim_run.py - run /ade's ngspice benches at one or more PVT corners (docs/
design.md 1.3, 1.5, "### M8."). Ported from /hwde's scripts/sim_run.py in
BEHAVIOR (bounds-driven scoring, one report per testbench), not mechanism:
engine/lib/simlib.py's own docstring covers the InSpice-shared-library ->
`eda ngspice -b` swap and why nothing here ever trusts ngspice's exit code.

    sim_run.py --workspace DIR [--corners NAME [NAME ...]] [--timeout SEC]
               [--out FILE]

For every `tb/*.cir` with a matching `tb/*.bounds.json` sidecar, at every
requested corner (default: corners.py's own default_corners(), design.md
5's "the four extremes with typical, never fewer"), materializes a runnable
deck - the bench file's own `{{PDK}}`/`{{CORNER}}`/`{{TEMP_C}}`/`{{VDD}}`/
`{{NETLIST}}`/`{{SIZING}}`/`{{RES_CORNER}}`/`{{MIM_CORNER}}` placeholders
filled in (simlib.materialize) -
runs it through `eda ngspice -b`, and scores it against the sidecar
(simlib.compare_bounds; a bound whose optional `corners` list does not
name this corner is skipped there) after checking for a known ngspice failure
signature regardless of exit code (simlib.detect_engine_errors). A bench
over a netlist with a poly resistor or MIM cap that hard-codes the typical
passive section while the sweep moves it is a passive_corner_unselected
error (unselected_passives).

A (bench, corner) pair where every bound in the bench's sidecar has a
`corners` list that leaves this corner out is not run at all (skip_unscored,
the default): nothing would be scored there, and a bench that gates its own
analysis on that list would only make ngspice report an empty run. Each
skipped pair is listed in the result's `not_scored` ({bench, corner,
reason}); a bench with any "all"-scoped bound runs at every corner. A bound
names a corner by any of its names (corners.names_of: a bound scoped
`tt_27c` is scored when the run's corner is `tt`, one scoped `tt_pss` is
not). A bench run at NO requested corner is listed in `out_of_scope` when
some corner of the spec's sweep scores it (sim_tt skips an ff-only bench
that sim_pvt runs - not a failure, not a pass), and is a
`sim_bench_not_run` error when none does, never a silent pass; so is a run
in which no bench ran at all. check_netlist_lint passes skip_unscored=False:
its dry run scores engine errors, not bounds, so it runs every bench.

check_netlist_lint.py, check_sim_tt.py, check_sim_pvt.py and
check_bench_strength.py call run_workspace_benches()/run_bench_at_corner()
directly, IN-PROCESS - the same shape check_sim.py uses for cocotblib
(docs/design.md 1.2: no bin/eda subprocess where none is needed) - never a
subprocess of this script. The CLI below is for standalone smoke use and
parity with /hwde's own sim_run.py entry point.

Timeout: each bench run gets the caller's limit - the gate's --timeout,
else the spec's `sim_timeout_s: {<gate>: N}` (speclib.sim_timeout), else
60 s - or longer when the bench asks for it with a comment line in its tb/*.cir -
`* sim_timeout_s: 600` - which the bench-writer sets for a long sweep (a
256-code DAC bench). The larger of the two wins, capped at
MAX_BENCH_TIMEOUT. A run that times out is a `sim_engine_error_sim_timeout`
finding, never a pass.
