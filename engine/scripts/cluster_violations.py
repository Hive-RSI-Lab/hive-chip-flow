"""cluster_violations.py - group open findings for fixer dispatch.

Ported from /hwde's scripts/cluster_violations.py, domain swapped (docs/
design.md 1.3): "the clustering key becomes file, module and finding kind" -
a PCB finding sits at a board (x, y) and clusters by spatial radius; a
chip-flow finding sits in a text artifact (an RTL file, a SPICE netlist, a
spec.yaml requirement) with no geometry, so clustering groups by the triple
(file, module, kind) directly - no spatial union-find, no bbox/region.

CLI: --input report.json  (any report with a `violations` list)
     [--out clusters.json]
Exit: 0 no clusters, 1 clusters present (work to do), 2 error.

Cluster schema:
    {"id", "file", "module", "kinds"[], "checks"[], "severity", "count",
     "fixer": "<domain>", "violations": [ ...the raw findings... ]}

# kind -> the fixer domain best suited to resolve it. Empty at M1 (every
# gate is a stub, so no real finding kind exists yet); each milestone that
# lands a real check_<gate>.py adds its finding kinds here as it learns
# them (docs/design.md 1.5's "planted fault" column is the source for each
# one). A finding without a matching kind falls back to its `check` name,
# then to 'review'.
#
# vde's own kinds land at M5 (docs/design.md, "### M5."): every kind M2/M3's
# check_<gate>.py scripts actually emit (grep checklib.violation( call sites
# under engine/scripts/check_*.py) gets a routing rule here, so the fix loop
# (skills/vde/SKILL.md) dispatches to the right fixer domain without a human
# in the loop for the common case. The judgment calls, spelled out once:
#   - `sim`/`holdout` test FAILURES read as the DESIGN being wrong against a
#     testbench written first, in fresh context, from the spec alone (docs/
#     design.md section 2) - they route to "rtl". A test that never ran
#     (skipped) or a requirement with no test tagged to it is a TESTBENCH
#     gap - "testbench". The one exception: a held-out test that died in
#     its own stimulus code before any assert ran (`holdout_stimulus_fault`,
#     check_holdout.py says exactly when) is the test's fault, not the
#     design's - "holdout_stimulus", a narrower testbench domain that may
#     touch holdout/ stimulus but nothing that judges.
#   - `mutate` scores the testbench, never the design ("a mutate failure
#     goes back to the tb-writer, not the rtl-writer", docs/design.md
#     section 2) - every survivor_* class and the kill-rate rollup route to
#     "testbench".
#   - `formal` property failures are exactly what formal exists to catch
#     that sim cannot ("formal is the answer to tests that pass too
#     easily") - "rtl". A second-engine disagreement or an unreached cover
#     point is a property-writer/property concern, not a design one -
#     "formal" (whose own guidance in fix_dispatch.DOMAINS already says
#     "widen the induction depth or fix the property, never loosen it").
#   - `cover` gaps are what the tests never reached - "testbench", matching
#     "Coverage says what the tests never reached" (docs/design.md
#     section 2).
#   - `synth` findings (latch, unmapped cell, combinational loop, undriven
#     net) are "almost always an RTL defect surfacing late" (fix_dispatch's
#     own synth-domain guidance) - "rtl".
#   - `lint` findings are RTL text defects - "rtl"; an unrecognized
#     verilator rule (a kind this table has never seen) still falls back to
#     "review" by design, same as any other unmapped kind.
#   - `release`'s own `gate_not_ready` is attest.py's coverage refusal, not
#     a design defect - "review" (the human/orchestrator reads which gate
#     is missing and re-enters the right phase; no script fixes this).
#   - `harden`/`timing`/`drc`/`lvs`/`glsim`/`precheck` (M4, docs/design.md
#     "### M4.") all findings on the ALREADY-hardened design (a LibreLane
#     flow step failing outright, a timing corner in violation, a DRC/LVS
#     mismatch, precheck) - "harden", matching fix_dispatch.DOMAINS'
#     existing "harden" guidance (set keys in harden/config.override.json
#     or fix the RTL, then re-run the harden job); never routed straight to "rtl" the way
#     synth's own findings are, because the fix is as often a harden
#     constraint (floorplan, clock period, pin order) as it is the design.
#     glsim's own `test_failed`/`test_skipped` are the one exception -
#     shared with sim/holdout above, since a functional bug that only
#     shows up gate-level is still a design defect ("harden" is silent
#     bystander there, not the domain to route it to).
