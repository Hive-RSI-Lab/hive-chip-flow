"""check_harden.py - the harden gate (docs/design.md 1.5, "### M4."). Runs
as a job (`jobs.py start --gate harden`, 1.7); this script IS the work a
detached `gate.py` invocation does when it runs.

    check_harden.py --workspace DIR [--out FILE]

Generates `harden/tt_um_<top>.v` and `harden/config.json`/`harden/info.yaml`
from spec.yaml's `tt_pins` (engine/lib/ttlib.py), then runs LibreLane 3
against the vendored TT GF180 template through `bin/eda librelane`
(never a bare `librelane` - docs/design.md 1.2). Passes when the flow
finishes with no failing step and `runs/<tag>/final/` carries GDS, LEF,
netlist, SDF and metrics (gates.yaml's `harden` row).

Per-design config: `harden/config.json` is REGENERATED on every run, so a
hand edit to it is discarded. A design's own LibreLane keys go in
`harden/config.override.json` - a JSON object merged last (e.g.
`{"RUN_POST_GRT_RESIZER_TIMING": 1}` for a small setup miss). It may not
set a key the engine or the TT template owns (tile/PDK keys, VERILOG_FILES,
the template's DO-NOT-CHANGE block, CLOCK_PERIOD - the clock is spec.yaml's):
such a key is a CheckError, exit 2. The file is its own `harden_override`
input in engine/reference/invalidation.yaml, so editing it stales harden.

Clocks: CLOCK_PORT is spec.yaml's primary clock domain (`clock.primary`, or
the one entry of `clock.domains`) mapped through tt_pins, at
clock.period_ns. Anything else - the other domains, generated clocks, false
paths - goes in `harden/constraints.sdc`, written against the TT wrapper's
ports. When it exists, `harden/flow.sdc` is regenerated each run (LibreLane's
base SDC, then that file) and becomes PNR_SDC_FILE and SIGNOFF_SDC_FILE.
CheckError, exit 2, when several domains are named without `clock.primary`
or without that file, or when the file redefines the primary clock or
leaves a domain without a clock (ttlib.prepare_harden_sdc). The file is the
`harden_sdc` input, so editing it stales harden onward (harden_config_edit).

Restart: the run tag is fixed ("run") and every invocation passes
`--overwrite`. LibreLane's own implicit resume (omit `--overwrite`, let it
load `runs/<tag>`'s latest `state_out.json`) was tried here first and is not
safe on the installed LibreLane 3 build - replayed even against a run
directory an EARLIER, fully successful attempt had left in `final/` with
nothing left to do, it still crashed (FileNotFoundError inside
`Step._reroute_env`, a step directory the flow never created, after
climbing well past the original run's own highest step number instead of
recognizing completion). A job killed halfway therefore finishes by redoing
the whole flow, not by continuing from its last completed step - correct
over clever, and on these tiny corpus designs a full run is a few minutes.

Failure classification (docs/design.md 1.9's "a gate that didn't run is a
refusal, never a pass", enforced here three ways):
  - the launcher never reached LibreLane at all (bad tt_pins so no wrapper
    could be generated, `eda` itself missing/misconfigured, a timeout
    before `runs/<tag>/flow.log` even appears) -> CheckError, exit 2.
  - LibreLane ran and a real step failed (nonzero exit, `flow.log` exists)
    -> a `violations` finding, exit 1 - this is the fault gates.yaml names
    ("a design too large for the tile": global placement/legalization
    fails outright).
  - LibreLane exits 0 but `final/` is missing an expected format -> a
    `violations` finding (a launcher/flow that silently drops output is
    exactly the "missing report" case the review calls out), never a
    silent pass.
