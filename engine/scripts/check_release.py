"""check_release.py - the release gate (docs/design.md 1.5, "### M3.").

    check_release.py --workspace DIR [--out FILE]

gates.yaml's `release` row names its tool "attest, strict" (docs/design.md
1.5's table) - this script is the check_<tool>.py wrapper gate.py's generic
dispatch (run_report_for_gate: import check_<tool>, call run(argv), expect
checklib's report shape) needs in order to run it exactly like every other
gate. The actual strict-release-coverage logic - walk every gate gates.yaml
registers for the skill, refuse unless each has a fresh recorded pass or a
durable waiver - already lives in attest.py's own build(); this script calls
it directly and reshapes its "problems" (plain strings) into checklib
violations so gate.py's evaluate() can apply gates.yaml's fail_severities/
max_count the same way it does for every other gate's findings.

"A gate that did not run is a refusal, never a pass" applies one level up
here too: attest.py's build() itself already refuses (returns problems, not
an attestation) for ANY gate with no recorded result, a stale one, or a
recorded FAIL - there is no path through this script that reports "pass"
without attest.py's own build() having produced a real attestation body.

On success, writes reports/checks.json (attest.py's write_attestation) -
docs/design.md section 2's "The record of what ran is the release."

An msde block (M10) owes one thing more: "both nested runs released, top
gates fresh" (docs/design.md 1.5's msde release row). Its two sides are
nested workspaces at `digital/` (skill vde) and `analog/` (skill ade), each
with its own state.json (docs/design.md 5); release refuses unless each
exists, carries the right skill, and its own reports/checks.json still
verifies against its current files and state (attest.py verify) - so a
nested RTL or netlist edit after that side released reads as a stale
nested release and refuses here, whatever the top gates say.
