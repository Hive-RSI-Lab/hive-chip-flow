"""check_lvs.py - the lvs gate (docs/design.md 1.5, "### M4.").

    check_lvs.py --workspace DIR [--out FILE]

Independently re-runs netgen (`eda netgen`, docs/design.md 1.2) comparing
the magic-extracted layout netlist (`harden/runs/run/final/spice/*.spice`,
"NGSPICE file created from *.ext" - LibreLane's own `Magic.SpiceExtraction`
step) against the post-synthesis, post-fill powered netlist
(`final/pnl/*.pnl.v`) plus the PDK's own standard-cell and IO spice models -
the exact same three-circuit recipe LibreLane's own internal `netgen-lvs`
step uses (read from its generated `lvs_script.lvs` once, empirically, to
get the PDK model list right; never re-guessed). LibreLane's own LVS
verdict is not trusted as this gate's answer - the design's point in
separating `lvs` from `harden` at all is a second, independent netgen run,
the same reasoning `timing` and `drc` follow. A from-scratch re-extraction
(`eda magic extract all` on the GDS, bypassing LibreLane's own extraction
step entirely) was tried here first and does not reproduce LibreLane's own
pin naming/property setup closely enough to match even a clean design
(a real gap - this gate is only as independent of `harden`'s own
extraction as that leaves it); `corpus/vde/*/faults/plant_lvs.py`
compensates by corrupting the extracted spice text directly rather than
the GDS: the fault splits one net in two in that extracted netlist, the
electrical effect of a missing via, so this exact comparison sees it.

Passes when netgen reports the two circuits equivalent (gates.yaml's `lvs`
row: "match").

Failure classification (the same three-way split as check_harden.py):
  - no hardened `final/` yet -> CheckError.
  - `eda netgen` times out, crashes, or the report never reaches a decidable
    verdict (neither "match" nor a Property/topology mismatch line) ->
    CheckError - a comparison that did not complete is a refusal, never a
    pass.
  - netgen completes and reports the circuits do not match -> a
    `violations` finding, exit 1.
