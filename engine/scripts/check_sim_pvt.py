"""check_sim_pvt.py - the sim_pvt gate (docs/design.md 1.5, "### M8."):
sim_run.py over the block's corner set (design.md 5: "the default is the
four extremes with typical, never fewer").

    check_sim_pvt.py --workspace DIR [--out FILE]

Pass criteria (gates.yaml): "Every measure inside its bound at every
corner." Fault this gate must catch: "meets at typical, loses headroom at
slow and hot" - engine/reference/corners.yaml's own `ss` default corner
(125 C, -10% supply) is exactly that combination.

Corner set: spec.yaml's top-level `corners` field, expanded by
corners.spec_corners() ("default" when absent) - that function's docstring
has the forms. A list is UNIONED with the default five, never used to
replace them - design.md 5's "never fewer" means what it says, so a spec
cannot skip a default corner (say, drop `ss` and have 'meets at typical,
loses headroom at slow and hot' go uncaught) by simply not naming it. A
`{grid: ...}` replaces the five with a PVT grid the spec declares, and
corners.grid_corners() refuses one that does not still span typical/ss/ff
and both temperature extremes. A design whose netlist uses a poly/diffusion
resistor or a MIM cap also sweeps corners.yaml's passive_corners (the
resistor and MIM spread the PDK keeps in its own sections), whatever form
the spec's `corners` takes.

Scoped-out dimensions: a passive corner dimension the person ruled out of
scope at H1, recorded from their answer with `state.py scope-out` (corners.py,
"Scoped-out dimensions"), is pinned at typical at every corner and only
that one: the other passive, process, temperature and supply are swept and
gated as before. The report's `scoped_out` lists each, with the person's
quote; a record in state.json that no longer verifies against the H1 answer
is an error (exit 2), never a silent sweep change.

Unscored corners: a bench is not run at a corner where no bound in its
sidecar is scored (sim_run.py's module docstring); the report's `not_scored`
lists each skipped {bench, corner, reason}, and a bench run at no corner of
the set is a `sim_bench_not_run` error. A bound names a corner by any of its
names (corners.names_of: `tt_27c` is `tt`). A bench that runs but holds a
bound scoped only to corners the set never sweeps (`[tt_pff]` on a netlist
with no resistor or MIM cap, or with that spread scoped out) is a
`sim_bound_not_swept` error per such bound: spec_lint accepts a passive
corner name without reading the netlist, so this is where an unscored bound
is refused rather than passed.
