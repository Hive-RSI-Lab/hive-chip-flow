"""check_top_harden.py - msde's top_harden gate (docs/design.md "### M10.":
"the digital side hardens with the analog GDS as a LibreLane macro").

    check_top_harden.py --workspace MSDE_WS [--out FILE]

An msde block holds its two sides as nested workspaces, `digital/` (vde) and
`analog/` (ade). This gate assembles the chip top at `top/` and hardens it
with M4's own harden (check_harden.run, the same LibreLane job):

  top/spec/spec.yaml  the digital spec, minus tt_pins for every signal
                      interface.yaml names, plus a `macros:` entry binding
                      each of those signals to the analog cell's pin of the
                      same name, or a width-N signal to its N pins
                      <name>[N-1]..<name>[0] (engine/lib/ttlib.py's macros
                      schema), its files named relative to top/
  top/rtl/            a copy of digital/rtl
  top/harden/constraints.sdc
                      the top's design SDC (ttlib.prepare_harden_sdc), for
                      a spec with more than one clock domain: the
                      integrator's own <ws>/top.sdc when there is one, else
                      digital/harden/constraints.sdc with each crossing
                      signal's standalone pad bit moved onto the macro's pin
                      ([get_ports {ui_in[3]}] -> [get_pins
                      {u_analog/vco_out}]; top_sdc). top/ is rebuilt every
                      run, so a file written there by hand never survives
  top/macros/         the analog cell as LibreLane takes a macro: its GDS
                      (layout_gen, rebuilt from analog/layout/gen_<block>.py
                      like every ade layout gate does), a LEF abstract magic
                      writes from that GDS, a blackbox Verilog stub, and its
                      sized .subckt for LVS

Analog pins that interface.yaml's `ua_pins: {<pin>: <k>}` names leave the
chip on the Tiny Tapeout analog pad ua[k]: the top becomes an analog tile
(`tiles`, from interface.yaml or the analog template's default), hardened
on the vendored analog pin template, and LibreLane routes each such pin
to its pad (engine/lib/ttlib.py, "Analog tile").
Analog pins that interface.yaml names nowhere are its supplies; the one
named like vdd goes to VPWR and the one like vss to VGND (PDN macro hookup).
The macro sits in the middle of the tile, slid along x by whole sites (no
further than one stripe pitch) to where the tile's Metal4 stripes reach
both its supplies past the cell's own Metal4 (power_location); where none
does, that is a `macro_power_unreachable` finding (no harden runs). With no
PR boundary, the macro's GDS gets one over what it draws (clean_gds),
which LibreLane's Magic.StreamOut needs. The recipe - LEF by magic's `lef
write`, the PDN's Metal3-Metal4 connect, extraction from GDS - is
docs/spikes/macro_harden.md's, except in two ways. The LEF abstract covers
everything the macro draws, never a PR boundary smaller than that (one a
flattened standard cell left behind); magic writing an abstract more than
1 um short of the drawn extent on either axis is a refusal. And the LEF is
written -pinonly: each port's pin is the rectangle of metal under its label
(a supply's adds its net's Metal3) and the rest of the macro is OBS, so the
router never lands on a port's internal wiring. A port label on no metal of
its own layer, or a port the LEF gives no pin 0.23 um a side, is a refusal;
a label that names no port is dropped, its metal OBS. The macro's GDS
is moved so what it draws starts at (0, 0), and a LEF ORIGIN other than
0 0 is a refusal: the final GDS puts the cell's origin where OpenROAD put
the abstract's lower-left, so the two must coincide. Before the LEF is
written the macro gets the PDK's dummy-COMP fill (fill_macro, the rules of
the PDK's fill_comp.rb), since the top's fill skips a macro and DCF.1a
judges the macro's inside at top_drc and the precheck. The tile's
Metal4 stripes join the macro on Metal3 only, so a supply pin with no
Metal3 shape is a `macro_power_unreachable` finding (no harden runs); a
supply's Metal3 the cell's own Metal4/Metal5 wholly covers (a via pad under
its strap) is not offered as a pin, since the PDN refuses a buried pin.

Refuses (exit 2) when either nested workspace or a piece the assembly needs
is missing. An analog macro larger than the tile - by its LEF SIZE or by
what its GDS draws, whichever is larger - is a `macro_too_large` finding
(no harden runs); so is a `ua_pins` map off the analog template - an
index used twice, a gap below the highest pad, more pads than the tile has
(`ua_pin_off_template`, no harden runs). LibreLane failures are
check_harden's findings, passed on.
