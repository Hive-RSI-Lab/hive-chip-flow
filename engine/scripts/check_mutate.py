"""check_mutate.py - the mutate gate (docs/design.md 1.5, "### M2.").

    check_mutate.py --workspace DIR [--size N] [--seed N] [--jobs N]
                    [--pdr-timeout S] [--out FILE]

Drives real mcy (yosys's mutation-coverage tool, foss/tools/yosys/bin/mcy -
not through `bin/eda mcy`, which cannot resolve it, docs/design.md 1.2 and
check_env.py's own check_mcy for why; this launches it the same way
check_env.py does, `eda python3 <the real mcy script>`) over a scratch mcy
project under `<workspace>/log/mutate/` (recreated fresh every run - a stale
mutation database is worse than a slower gate). `[script]` reads rtl/
without SYNTHESIS defined (what the sim gate tests, so a PDK cell kept
under `ifdef SYNTHESIS` is not left in the mutants) and elaborates with a
fixed `--top` from spec.yaml; `mutate -list <size> -seed
<seed>` (yosys's own pass, gates.yaml's "fixed seed, N mutants") samples the
design for candidate mutations; `[test sim]` (mutate_runner.py, one process
per mutant) yosys-applies each mutation to the frozen design and runs the
workspace's VISIBLE tb/ cocotb suite against it - PASS = survived, FAIL =
killed. A mutant mcy tags `-mode none` is its own built-in do-nothing
baseline (not a real mutation) and is excluded from every count here.
Every mcy, sby and yosys run goes through checklib.run_group(), so a
timeout, or this process being killed, takes the tool's whole process tree
(mcy's sims included) down with it.

Kill-rate classification (this script's own scheme - gates.yaml names three
must-kill CLASSES but not a mechanism; nothing in mcy exposes a mutation's
own parameters to its `[logic]` section, so classification happens here,
after the run, straight off yosys's own `mutate -list` output strings):
  -mode inv                                  -> condition_inverted
  -mode const0/const1, -wire == "rst"        -> reset_removed  (a fixed,
                                                 project-wide convention: the
                                                 reset port is named 'rst')
  -mode const0/const1, -wire in an output port (spec.yaml `ports`, dir:
                                                 output)         -> output_stuck
  -mode const0/const1, otherwise             -> stuck_other
  -mode cnot0/cnot1                          -> conditional_stuck
  anything else                              -> other

Pass criteria (gates.yaml `mutate` row): kill rate >= 0.9, and no survivor in
{reset_removed, output_stuck, condition_inverted} (severity "error"; a
survivor outside those classes is reported at severity "info" - visible, not
failing). Fault this gate must catch: "a testbench that asserts nothing" (a
tb/ that never fails, however hard the design is mutated, drives kill rate
to ~0 and every survivor class fires) - and, just as fatal in the other
direction, "a testbench that doesn't even run" (an import error, a broken
fixture): every mutant crashes the same way the unmutated design does, mcy's
own `[logic]` counts every crash as a kill, and kill rate reads a false 1.0.
check_baseline() below catches that one, off mcy's own `-none` baseline row
(mutation id 1) rather than off any real mutant.

Equivalent mutants: a survivor no test could ever kill - because the
mutation does not change what the design does - is not a testbench gap.
Equivalent here means: started from reset (every FF at zero, or its
declared init), the mutant and the unmutated design give identical PRIMARY
OUTPUTS on every cycle for every input sequence; internal signals may
differ. After mcy runs, each SURVIVED mutant (in parallel) gets a proof over
a proof (prove_equivalent()): first yosys equiv_induct over every
name-matched signal (zero-init base case; all signals agreeing implies the
outputs do), then, over a miter of the two designs' outputs, k-induction in
yosys (a zero-init base case, then `sat -tempinduct`, the whole yosys
run bounded by EQUIV_TIMEOUT_S), and, only if the base case held but the induction step
did not, an unbounded model check over reachable states (sby `abc pdr`, up
to --pdr-timeout, default PDR_TIMEOUT_S = 30 minutes per mutant). The proof
also assumes a single clock straight from an input and asynchronous resets
acting at clock granularity. When the whole top is outside that clock
model (two clock domains, say) the same proof runs once more on the mutated
module alone - the `-module` mcy names, reference against mutant at that
module's own ports - and a PASS there stands for the top, since a module
whose outputs never differ cannot change anything around it; the reason
then ends "(module <m> alone, at its own ports)". A mutant in the top
module itself gets no such retry. A design or mutant outside the model, a
counterexample, a timeout or a tool error all leave the mutant a normal
survivor. Only a complete proof moves it - or the owner's ruling on that
one mutant: a survivor listed by id under `equivalent` in the workspace's
spec/mutant_rulings.yaml (engine/lib/rulingslib.py, with who ruled and the
evidence) is accepted without being sent to the prover, recorded in
`equivalent_by` as "accepted by owner ruling: <ruling>". A ruling that names
a killed mutant or an id mcy did not generate is refused (exit 2), so a
stale ruling cannot sit silently, and `below_spread` (an analog-only ruling)
is refused here. Kill rate = killed / (total - equivalent), and each proven
or ruled mutant is reported at severity "info" as `equivalent_<class>` (a
must-kill class included - it cannot be killed), with facts `equivalent`
and `equivalent_ids`. If every mutant is equivalent there is nothing left
to score, and that is an error, not a pass.

    started from reset (every FF at zero, or its declared init), the two
    give the same PRIMARY OUTPUTS on every cycle for every input sequence.
    Internal signals are free to differ - a mutant that changes a register
    no output ever reflects is still equivalent.

    First, prove_signal_induction(): every name-matched signal agrees from
    reset and that agreement is inductive (yosys equiv_induct). That
    implies the outputs agree; it only misses mutants that differ
    internally, which the routes below cover.

    The next two routes check one miter of the two flattened modules (`miter
    -equiv -flatten -make_assert`: an assert per cycle that every output
    agrees). First by k-induction in yosys: a base case (`sat -seq N
    -prove-asserts -set-init-zero`: from reset the outputs agree for N
    cycles) and then `sat -tempinduct -maxsteps N` (N agreeing cycles
    from ANY state imply the next one agrees). Together they are an
    unbounded proof under three stated assumptions: FFs start at zero (or
    their declared init), one clock (single_clock() refuses anything else,
    on both the reference and the mutant), and asynchronous resets act at
    clock granularity (`async2sync`).

    The induction step checks ARBITRARY states, so a mutant that differs
    only on (or only inside) states the design never reaches can fail it.
    Only then - never for a base-case counterexample (a real difference),
    a timeout, an error or a clock refusal - prove_reachable() gets one
    more try over reachable states (pdr_timeout).

    `top` is the `hierarchy` argument that picks the design under proof:
    the whole top by default, `-top <module>` for prove_equivalent()'s
    module-scoped retry.
