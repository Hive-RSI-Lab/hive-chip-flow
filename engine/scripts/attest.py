"""attest.py - the record of what ran (docs/design.md 1.5's `release` gate,
section 2's "The record of what ran is the release").

Ported from /hwde's scripts/attest.py, scoped down for M1: /hwde's
attest.py delegates to lib/releaselib.py (fab package hashes, durable
waiver bindings, a hand-set-proof disposition ladder from draft through
ordered/built) - none of that is in engine/lib/ (docs/design.md 1.1 lists
checklib, safelib, statelib, benchlib, simlib, speclib only) because a
board's fab/order concepts don't port. What attest.py owns is the part that
does: walk every gate gates.yaml registers for the block's skill, check each
has a recorded pass whose input hashes match the files now (statelib
freshness), and write reports/checks.json - gate, tool, result, inputs,
timestamp. M1's gates were all stubs, so build() always refused; M3 ("###
M3.") is where a real release can happen, and where a scoped-down waiver/
durability mechanism lands (load_waivers/waiver_problems below) - scoped
down because a board's fab/order concepts (/hwde releaselib's durable-waiver
required fields beyond reason+approved, its manufacturing-option waivers)
don't port, but the CORE idea does: a waiver binds to the gate's CURRENT
input hashes (freshness_report's current_inputs, re-hashed from the files on
disk every call - never the gate's own last RECORDED inputs, which stay
frozen at record time and so would let a waiver approved on RTL A silently
keep covering the gate after the RTL moves to B with no re-run in between)
and to checklib.CHECKER_VERSION, so an artifact edit or a checker semantics
bump invalidates it and it must be re-approved. A waiver is also refused
outright whenever the gate's own hash_valid is False (its last recorded run
no longer matches the current files): a waiver never covers a gate that has
not actually run against the inputs it is being asked to cover.

A dimension the person scoped out at H1 (corners.py, "Scoped-out
dimensions" - sim_pvt pins it at typical) is part of the record: build()
writes each, with the person's quote, as the attestation's `scoped_out`
(re-verified against the H1 answer; one that does not verify refuses), and
verify() treats a scope-out added or dropped since as a stale attestation.

Subcommands:
  build        Assemble + write reports/checks.json. Refuses (status
               violations, exit 1, nothing written) unless every applicable
               gate has a fresh recorded pass. The refusal lists every miss
               at once.
  verify       Re-verify the written checks.json against the current tree
               and state. Read-only. Exit 0 valid / 1 invalid.
  disposition  Print the DERIVED release disposition (never hand-set):
               draft (nothing has passed yet), in-progress (some gates
               green), gates-green (every applicable gate fresh-pass),
               blocked (a gate has a recorded FAIL). Read-only.

CLI: JSON to stdout or --out; exit 0 ok / 1 refused-or-invalid /
2 operational error.
