"""check_cover.py - the cover gate (docs/design.md 1.5, "### M3.").

    check_cover.py --workspace DIR [--out FILE]

Runs the SAME cocotb tests `sim` runs (tb/test_*.py), but over the VERILATOR
simulator instead of Icarus, built with `--coverage --coverage-line
--coverage-toggle`. `verilator_coverage --write-info` (an lcov-shaped .info:
`DA:<line>,<count>` for line hits, `BRDA:<line>,<branch>,<label>,<count>`
for both real branches AND verilator's own toggle points - the two are told
apart here by the label's own shape: a toggle label always ends
`<signal>:0->1`/`<signal>:1->0`, a real branch label never does) is the
parsed source, not the raw `coverage.dat` (a packed, escaped key format not
meant for hand-parsing) and not `--annotate`'s text report (a rendering,
not data).

Two things this gate had to prove empirically before trusting either
number, both now load-bearing here:
  - `bin/eda python3 ...` did not put verilator's own driver script on PATH
    at all (only `eda verilator ...`'s top-level dispatch did) until this
    milestone's fix to bin/eda's `python3|python)` case - a cocotb-over-
    verilator run from inside a check script is new at M3, nothing before
    it needed this path.
  - `eda verilator_coverage ...` used to always exec the `verilator`
    COMPILER driver regardless of which of the three names
    (verilator|verilator_coverage|verilator_gantt) was asked for - a latent
    bug in bin/eda's verilator_entry/dispatch (verilator_coverage is its
    own perl driver, with its own dbg binary, not a flag to `verilator`
    itself) that this milestone's fix also closes, for the same reason: no
    gate needed the real tool before this one.

Pass criteria (gates.yaml `cover` row): line coverage >= `line_min` (spec.yaml
`cover.line_min`, default 95%), toggle coverage >= `cover.toggle_min`
(default 90%), restricted to the DUT's own rtl/ file(s) - a testbench or
cocotb support file is never instrumented in the first place (only rtl/
sources are handed to `--coverage`), so no extra filtering is needed for
that half; multiple rtl/ files are each counted by their own `SF:` block.
`rtl/cover_exclude.yaml` (optional; a list of `{file, line, reason}` for a
line and/or `{file, line, label, reason}` for one toggle edge) removes
exactly the named point from both the covered and total counts - "exclusions
carry reasons" (gates.yaml) mirrors check_lint.py's own `lint_allow.yaml`.

Fault this gate must catch (gates.yaml): "an unreachable state" - a branch
or line the visible tb/ suite never reaches, dragging line coverage below
`line_min`.
