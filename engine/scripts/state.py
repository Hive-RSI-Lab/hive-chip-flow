"""state.py - state.json read/write helpers for the chip-flow engine.

Ported from /hwde's scripts/state.py (docs/design.md 1.3-1.4), schema v3:
`board` becomes `skill` (vde|ade|msde) + `block`, the build-mode concept
(modeslib, PCB-only) is dropped, gate ordering is DERIVED from gates.yaml
instead of a hardcoded pipeline spine (three skills, three different
pipelines - docs/design.md 1.5), and three sections are new: `toolchain`
(the eda image + PDK this run's gates ran against), `jobs` (detached gate
runs, 1.7) and `holdout` (the corpus/testbench holdout hash pinned at
creation, section 2). state.json is still the single source of truth for one
block's run: the orchestrator NEVER carries pipeline state in its context, it
reads the resume summary, acts, and records every transition here. Every
mutating subcommand appends a timestamped event to `history`.

    mark = {ts, edit_class, refs, human_hold} - stamped by `edit` from
    reference/invalidation.yaml, or on a gate by a run of it that ended in
    error (edit_class "gate_error", + error; gate.py), cleared by
    record-gate (gates) / re-register (artifacts). A gate is FRESH iff its recorded input hashes all match the
    current normalized hashes AND it carries no mark (engine/lib/statelib.py).
    The recorded hashes are the ones the run READ: a result carrying
    `inputs_at_start` (gate.py hashes the inputs before its check runs) is
    recorded against those, so an input edited while a long gate ran leaves
    the result stale, never fresh against a file the gate did not read; the
    kinds that moved go in last.inputs_changed_during_run.

`set-phase` REFUSES to advance past a gate phase whose gate has no recorded
result or whose last recorded result is a FAIL. `gate.py --workspace <ws>`
records the result itself, so the normal flow never sees the refusal;
`--force` is the escape hatch for gate evidence only and logs `phase_forced`
with the missing and failed gates.

Human checkpoints need an answer given AT the checkpoint, never a note
written beforehand (a brief that says "H1 is approved" is not an answer).
`present` records the checkpoint with a digest of what is being shown (phase,
every gate's last result, every artifact hash, the phase digest file) and
prints a fresh random challenge, e.g. `H1-3fa9c2`, that the presentation
shows the person. `human` then REFUSES unless the checkpoint was presented and
not yet answered, the `--answer` text (the person's reply, verbatim) contains
that challenge, and the digest still matches - so nothing written before the
presentation can satisfy it however it is worded, and a state that moved after
the presentation must be presented again. `set-phase` REFUSES to advance past
a phase whose checkpoint (CHECKPOINTS below) is not approved, `--force` or not.

CLI `log` event names are machine keys: ^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}$ - prose
belongs in --data {"msg": ...}. `log --event spawn --data {...}`
additionally appends the data to the first-class `spawns` ledger.

Writes are atomic (unique temp + fsync + os.replace, same directory;
engine/lib/safelib.py). Writer safety: every CLI mutation holds the
OS-exclusive writer lock <state.json>.lock across load->mutate->save, and
State.save() is a base-digest compare-and-swap - a State loaded from bytes X
refuses to overwrite a file that is no longer X (StaleWriteError, exit 2).
`--if-digest SHA` lets a caller pin its own read (show/resume report
`digest`). Snapshot/restore are CONTAINED (no absolute/traversal/symlink
entries, in either direction) and restore is transactional.
