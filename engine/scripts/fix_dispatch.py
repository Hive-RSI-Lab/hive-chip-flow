"""fix_dispatch.py - turn a failed gate into fixer work orders.

Ported from /hwde's scripts/fix_dispatch.py (docs/design.md 1.3), domain
swapped: the uniform fix-loop protocol is unchanged (a gate fails -> cluster
the failing findings, cluster_violations.py -> ONE fixer agent per cluster,
where clusters don't share a file they may run in parallel -> fixers edit
via scripts only -> re-run the gate), but the fixer taxonomy is chip-flow's
own (rtl/testbench/holdout_stimulus/formal/synth/harden/layout/sizing/
review, docs/design.md 1.9's agent roles) instead of PCB's (router/placement/plane/silk/...), and
"region" (a board bbox) is gone - clusters key on (file, module, kind).

DOMAINS' `scripts` lists are placeholders at M1: the skill directories that
would hold rtl-writer/fixer/etc. agents and their real tool scripts do not
exist yet (docs/design.md, "### M1." - "No skill directories"). Each lists
the engine scripts a fixer in that domain can already reach; a skill
milestone (M2+) adds the real per-domain tool as it lands.

CLI: fix_dispatch.py --input gate_result.json --workspace WS

Exit: 0 nothing to dispatch, 1 orders written (work to do), 2 error.
