"""check_mc.py - the mc gate (docs/design.md 1.5, "### M8."): ngspice Monte
Carlo, only when spec.yaml asks for it.

    check_mc.py --workspace DIR [--out FILE]

Pass criteria (gates.yaml): "Yield at or above the spec." Fault: "not
applicable by default" - a block whose spec.yaml carries no `mc` block, or
`mc.enabled: false`, is NOT a stub: this script actually evaluates the spec
and reports `applicable: false` with zero violations, a real pass on a real
question ("does this spec ask for MC?"), never a skip. gate.py's own rule
("a gate whose tool could not run is exit 2, never a pass") is about a tool
that never ran at all - this one ran and answered "not applicable". The
corpus mirror rung's spec.yaml turns MC on, and its faults/plant_mc.py is
this gate's planted fault: an iout window typical meets but mismatch misses.

When `mc.enabled: true`: this box's own gf180mcuD design.spice does NOT
default both switches on the way the PDK's own comment block claims ("
(default) - sw_stat_global=1 and sw_stat_mismatch=1") - the file itself
then sets `.param sw_stat_global=0` / `.param sw_stat_mismatch=0` right
below that comment, and pins no `.option seed` at all. Left alone, every
`mc.runs` re-run of the same 'tt'-corner bench is the SAME deterministic
operating point repeated - zero mismatch, zero seed variation, one sample
wearing a yield percentage. So this gate injects `.param sw_stat_mismatch=1`
(and, when spec.yaml's `mc.global` asks for it, `sw_stat_global=1` too) plus
a per-run `.option seed=<mc.seed base + i>` into the GENERATED bench deck -
right after that bench's own `.include '.../design.spice'` (or design.ngspice) line, so the
override lands AFTER the PDK's own zeros are parsed - never by editing the
PDK's own read-only design.spice. Each of the `mc.runs` independent ngspice
invocations then draws a fresh, seeded sample of the PDK's own
agauss()-driven per-instance mismatch parameters (mis_vth, mis_k, mis_r,
...), and yield = the fraction with zero bound violations, scored against
`mc.yield_min`.

Two refusals a caller must not be able to talk this gate out of: `mc.runs:
0` is refused outright (CheckError, exit 2), never silently widened back up
to DEFAULT_RUNS - an explicit "run zero samples" is not the same request as
"no runs field at all"; and every sample producing BIT-IDENTICAL measures
(mismatch/seed injection above did nothing - a broken bench template, a
regressed PDK path, or this script's own regex silently matching zero
times) is refused too, rather than reported as a suspiciously-perfect
yield. `hits == 0` (every sample failed) is also always a violation,
regardless of how low `mc.yield_min` is set - a spec that nominally
tolerates a low yield still never tolerates ALL samples failing.
