"""check_top_lvs.py - msde's top_lvs gate (docs/design.md 1.5 msde table:
"netgen on the assembled GDS, the analog block as a subcircuit", match).

    check_top_lvs.py --workspace MSDE_WS [--out FILE]

layout side     a fresh magic extraction of the GDS top_harden left at
                top/harden/runs/run/final/gds, by LibreLane's own recipe
                (readspice the standard-cell spice first so each cell's ports
                come out numbered as the library has them, `load -dereference`,
                `ext2spice lvs`). The analog macro is just another subcell of
                that GDS, so it comes out as its transistors.
schematic side  the standard-cell spice, the analog cell's sized .subckt
                (top/macros/<cell>.spice) and LibreLane's powered gate-level
                netlist - M4's lvs recipe (check_lvs.py) with the macro added
                and without `-blackbox`, so the macro is compared device by
                device, never matched as an empty box.
setup           the PDK's own netgen setup (libs.tech/netgen/<pdk>_setup.tcl),
                the file LibreLane's Netgen.LVS step reaches through its
                wrapper setup.tcl. The wrapper itself is not used: it sources
                two variables only a LibreLane step sets, and outside one
                netgen skips it with a warning and compares with no device
                rules at all (source/drain not permutable, ad/as/pd/ps held
                as properties), which fails a clean design.

Pass is "Circuits match uniquely" with no subcell that failed to match and
no property error anywhere: the PDK setup drops the extraction-only
properties, so a property error left is a real W/L/nf difference.
Anything else is a `netlist_mismatch` finding. The run refuses (exit 2)
when netgen gives no verdict, when it reports errors reading the setup
file, and when the macro holds no PDK device at all on the schematic
side, or its cell in the extraction holds fewer devices of some kind
than its .subckt has - the macro went in as a blackbox (or empty), and a
match on that would be hollow. Devices are the PDK's primitives of every
kind (fets, resistors, caps, diodes, bjts), counted with their m= down
the macro's own hierarchy; a standard cell inside the macro is expanded
through the standard-cell spice on the schematic side and through its
extracted body (or that same spice, if magic left it abstract) on the
layout side, so both sides are counted alike. The recipe is
docs/spikes/macro_harden.md's.
