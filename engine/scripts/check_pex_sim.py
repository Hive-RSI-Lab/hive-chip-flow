"""check_pex_sim.py - the ade `pex_sim` gate (docs/design.md 1.5, 5,
"### M9.").

    check_pex_sim.py --workspace DIR [--block NAME] [--timeout SEC] [--out FILE]

Regenerates the GDS fresh (layout_gen.build(), same discipline as
check_analog_drc.py/check_analog_lvs.py), extracts it with magic including
parasitics - every capacitor down to 0 fF, and the wire resistance of
every net that reaches a transistor (layoutlib.run_magic_extract) - and
refuses a netlist that came back with no R and no C line at all, since a
"post-layout" run on that is the schematic again. klayout_pex as the second
extractor is not wired up at M9.

Then it runs the block's post-layout bench, `tb/<block>_pex_tb.cir` or
`layout_ref/<block>_pex_tb.cir`, at the typical corner against the
extracted netlist, and checks every value the bench prints (`print` or
`meas` in its .control block, "name = value") against the same-stem
`.bounds.json`'s `measures` map ({name: {min, max}}). A bench here should
measure what parasitics move - a pole, a delay, a settling time - not only
a DC point that a wire's capacitance cannot touch.

The bench template carries two substitution tokens, `{pdk}` (the resolved
toolchain's PDK root) and `{extracted}` (the parasitic netlist this run
just produced), so it runs unchanged on any host. The bench instantiates
the extracted cell positionally in the pin order of M8's netlist, and magic
numbers ports in an order of its own, so the extracted `.subckt` line is
rewritten into the reference's pin order first; a pin set that differs is
a refusal.

Ground is checked before the bench runs. A reference subckt that reaches
ngspice's global ground (a node `0`, or its alias `gnd`) without a port for
it needs the extracted netlist to carry a node of that name too - magic
names a net `0` when the layout puts a non-pin text label "0" on it (a
drawing-layer label such as metal1 34/0; a pin-layer label would make it a port and change the pin set).
Without one, the layout's ground is a local net of magic's own naming and
the bench runs with it floating. The gate never guesses which extracted net
is ground - a substrate net and a ground wire both carry magic-made names,
and tying the wrong one would pass a layout that is wired wrong - so a
missing ground label is a `ground_unlabelled` finding for the layout
generator, and no bench is run on that netlist.

Probes are checked the same way, before the bench runs. A bench that reads
a net inside the extracted cell (`v(xdut.s1)` in its .control block, where
`xdut` instantiates the top cell) needs that net to keep its name through
extraction, and magic keeps a name only where the layout puts a text label
on the net. An unlabelled net comes back as `a_..#`, and ngspice then
either warns that the vector is not available or refuses the whole run
with an error that names no net. So a probed net that the reference
netlist has and the extracted netlist does not is a `probe_unlabelled`
finding for the layout generator, one per net, and no bench is run. A
probe of a net the reference does not have either is a bench bug, not a
layout one, and is left to ngspice to refuse.

The bench run has a time limit: --timeout when given, else the spec's
`sim_timeout_s: {pex_sim: N}` (speclib.sim_timeout; a large RC netlist can
take minutes), else 120 s. A run past it is a refusal whose remediation
names that knob, never a pass.

"the worst corner" (docs/design.md 1.5) is not run here - M9's own
boundary is proving the extract-then-resim path on typical; the full
corner sweep is `/ade`'s `sim_pvt`-style job, out of scope until the skill
session lands.
