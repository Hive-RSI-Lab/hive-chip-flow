"""gate.py - evaluate a pipeline gate (docs/design.md 1.5).

    gate.py --gate <name> --workspace DIR [--skill vde|ade|msde]
            [--out FILE] [--commit MSG] [--no-record]
    gate.py --gate <name> --report <check-report.json> [--workspace DIR]
    gate.py --list [--skill vde]

A gate (defined in reference/gates.yaml, one table per skill) runs its
check_<tool>.py (M1: every tool is the stub, engine/scripts/check_stub.py -
docs/design.md, "### M1.") against the workspace and applies pass criteria:
it FAILS when the count of findings whose severity is in the gate's
fail_severities exceeds max_count. On pass, --commit MSG git-adds and
commits the block's own workspace directory, never the whole repo; it never
commits on failure and never pushes.

JSON to stdout (or --out): {script, gate, skill, status:pass|fail|
not_applicable, counts, criteria, failing:[findings that triggered],
inputs_at_start?, record_result, commit_result?}.
An error goes to --out as well, as {script, gate, status:error, error,
remediation}, so a caller reading --out never finds an earlier run there.
Exit 0 = pass or not applicable, 1 = fail, 2 = error (bad gate name,
missing tool, unreadable workspace, or a requested record/commit that did not
happen).

NOT APPLICABLE is its own answer, never a pass. A check that reports
`applicable: false` (check_mc.py on a spec with no `mc.enabled: true`) makes
the gate's status "not_applicable": it is not recorded in state.json (release
re-reads the spec for it every build, attest.not_applicable_reason) and
--commit commits nothing, because the caller's message titles a pass.

Ported from /hwde's scripts/gate.py (docs/design.md 1.3), generalized: hwde
dispatched per KiCad tool (erc/drc/verify/place/dfm/sim, each its own
Python function calling kc.py or a sibling script with bespoke args); every
chip-flow gate instead runs the SAME shape - `check_<tool>.py --workspace
<ws>` - dynamically imported and called as a sibling script's `run(argv)`,
so a new gate needs no change here, only a new check_<gate>.py and a
gates.yaml row. Waiver/durability handling (release-context strict gates)
is /hwde's U5 and is M3's job here (docs/design.md, "### M3.") - not ported
yet; `strict` and `--waivers` are reserved but unused at M1.

The gate RECORDS ITSELF. When the input sits inside a workspace (a
directory holding a state.json - found by walking the input's parents, or
named outright with --workspace), the result goes through
state.record_gate: input hashes, attempt count, stale-mark clearing all
apply. The input hashes are taken when the gate STARTS, before its check
reads anything (hash_inputs_at_start), and travel in the result as
`inputs_at_start`; record_gate records those, not the files as they stand
when the run ends. An input edited while a long gate ran therefore leaves
the result stale (its recorded hash no longer matches), never fresh against
a file the check did not read, and the result's
record_result.inputs_changed_during_run names the kinds that moved. A
--report run has no start to hash at, so its inputs are hashed at record
time as before. Pass AND fail are recorded (the fix loop wants every attempt). A
scratch/corpus input with no workspace records nothing, and the result says
so (`record_result.recorded: false` + reason); --no-record opts out
explicitly. An ERROR is never recorded as a result, but when the check
itself ends in error (refused, crashed, not built) the gate's earlier
recorded result gets a stale mark (mark_gate_error, edit_class
"gate_error"), so an older pass stops reading as fresh: a gate that did
not run is a refusal, never a pass. --no-record skips that too. A
REQUESTED-but-failed record is an operational error (exit 2),
exactly like a requested-but-failed commit: a caller keying on exit 0 must
not believe the evidence was preserved when it was not. With the record goes
the run's whole result, to reports/recorded/gate-<g>.json stamped with the
recorded ts (write_recorded_copy): state.json keeps only a few scalar facts,
and the design document (design_doc.py) reads the rest from that copy. It is
written before state.json is saved, so a copy that cannot be written leaves
the result unrecorded (exit 2), never recorded without its detail.
