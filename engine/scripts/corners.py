"""corners.py - PVT corner expansion for /ade (docs/design.md 1.4, 5,
"### M8."). New at M8: no /hwde precedent (a PCB flow has no process
corner) - reads engine/reference/corners.yaml, the raw axes and the default
sweep (that file's own header explains the pairing choice).

    corners.py [--corners-yaml PATH] [--names N1 N2 ...] [--out FILE]

With no --names, prints the default corner set (`default_corners`). With
--names, prints exactly those corners by name, in the order given - a
block's spec.yaml `corners:` list (design.md 1.4) names a subset (or
superset, via add-corner) of this file's default_corners this way, and may
name a passive_corners or passive_skew_corners entry too.

A spec's `corners` field is one of: "default" (the five above), "all" (the
full process x temperature x supply cross product), a list of corner names
(UNIONED with the default five, never a replacement - design.md 5's "never
fewer"), or `{grid: {process: [...], temp_c: [...], supply_pct: [...]}}`, a
cross product the spec declares itself, e.g. tt/ff/ss x -40/25/125 C at a
fixed VDD. A grid REPLACES the default five, so it must still span them:
its process list holds typical, ss and ff, and its temp_c list holds the
axis' coldest and hottest points. Temperatures and supplies may be any value
inside the axis range (25 C is not an axis point, but lies inside it);
supply_pct defaults to [0], the spec's own nominal VDD. Grid corners are
named `<process>_<temp>c[_v<supply>]` (typical -> tt, a minus sign -> m):
`ss_m40c`, `tt_25c`, `ff_125c_vp10`. A grid may add `extra: [name, ...]`,
corners.yaml entries appended after the grid's own (skipping any already in
it); that is how a grid spec opts into passive_skew_corners (ss_pff, ff_pss).

Passive spread. The PDK keeps poly/diffusion resistor sheet resistance
(`.lib res_<p>`, ppolyf_u_1k +/-20%) and MIM capacitance (`.lib
mimcap_<p>`, +/-10-15%) in sections of their own, p in corners.yaml's
`passive` axis (typical, ss = more R and C, ff = less). A corner's passive
section is its `passive` key, else its own process where the PDK has one
(ss -> ss, ff -> ff) and typical otherwise (passive_of) - so the default
five only ever move R and C together with the transistors. A design whose
netlist uses a poly/diffusion resistor or a MIM cap (passive_devices) gets
corners.yaml's `passive_corners` appended to whatever its spec sweeps
(spec_corners' `passives`): typical transistors at each RC extreme.
`passive_skew_corners` (each transistor extreme at the opposite RC
extreme, the charge-pump against loop-filter corners) are swept only when
a spec's `corners` list names them - corners.yaml says why.

Scoped-out dimensions. A person may rule one passive corner dimension out
of scope at H1 (say "MIM capacitor spread is out of scope for this rung").
`state.py scope-out --dimension mim_cap --quote '<their words>'` records it
on the approved H1 record as `human.H1.scope_out`, and only when the quote
is verbatim in that record's answer or note, lies inside one clause
(SCOPE_CLAUSE_RE), and the whole clause it sits in names that dimension
and no other (SCOPE_DIMENSIONS) and says it is out of scope (SCOPE_OUT_RE)
without a negation anywhere before it (SCOPE_NEGATED_RE): the person's text is the source, never the session's. spec_corners(pinned=)
then holds that one device at typical at every corner (a corner's
`pinned` key, which passive_of(corner, device) honours) and stops adding
passive_corners on its account; every other axis, the other passive
included, is swept as before. Every reader re-verifies the record
(recorded_scope_outs), so a hand-edited state.json is a refusal.

Not a gate (no workspace, no violations) - a plain reference-data reader,
so its CLI contract is checklib's minus the pass/violations status: exit 0
on success, 2 on a bad corners.yaml or an unknown --names entry.
