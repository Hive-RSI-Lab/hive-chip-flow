"""check_formal.py - the formal gate (docs/design.md 1.5, "### M3.").

    check_formal.py --workspace DIR [--out FILE]

Runs SymbiYosys (`sby`, through `bin/eda`) over `formal/*.sv` - a small
structural wrapper module that instantiates the DUT and adds `` `ifdef
FORMAL `` immediate assert/cover statements (yosys's own formal frontend has
no SVA `assert property (@(...) ...)` support - proved empirically; only
procedural, i.e. "immediate", `assert (...)`/`cover (...)` inside an
`always` block work) referencing the DUT's ports directly.

Frontend. yosys's native `read -formal` is unsound on two things, both
proved empirically: it silently drops a `bind` (a bound always-false
assert never reaches sby's model), and it leaves a hierarchical reference
(`dut.q`) as an implicitly declared, undriven wire that sby turns into a
free input - or drops the assert outright inside a named block. So before
sby runs, pick_frontend probes the design with both frontends (hierarchy,
proc, flatten, then count property cells) and switches every task to the
yosys-slang plugin (`read_slang`, which resolves both) when native reports a
dotted implicit identifier, formal/*.sv holds a `bind`, native's model
has fewer property cells than slang's, or native could not read the design
at all while slang could (a hierarchical reference inside an expression,
`dut.a - dut.b`, stops native with an AST_AUTOWIRE error before it logs the
implicit identifier). A probe counts as reaching its property count only
when its own `log` line is in the output on a line of its own - yosys
echoes the whole -p script first, marks included. Slang needed but missing
from the toolchain, or unable to read the design, is a refusal - never a
quiet fall back to native - and so is neither frontend reading it (the
refusal names both errors). Under slang a property's sby id is its hierarchical name
(`dut.u_chk.LABEL`, `blk.LABEL`); a `property:` label matches an exact id,
else the one id whose last dotted component it is (two is refused as
ambiguous). The report carries `frontend` and `frontend_why`.

Clocks. Without sby's `multiclock on`, every flop ticks on every solver
step whatever its clock does, so a design with more than one clock, a
negedge flop or an async reset/latch is modelled wrongly: two input clocks
tied by an `assume` (a prescaler, a divider) make the assumptions
unsatisfiable, and an engine that does not check that then passes every
assert vacuously. The same probe dumps every flop, latch and clocked
check of the flattened model (clocking) and needs_multiclock turns
`multiclock on` for every task when it finds two or more clock signals, a
negative-edge one, or an async reset/load/latch cell. spec.yaml's
`formal: {multiclock: true}` forces it on; `multiclock: false` on a design
that needs it is refused. Under multiclock a clock is a free input and a
solver step is one clock EDGE, not a cycle, so `depth`/`cover_depth` count
edges (about twice the cycles). The report carries `multiclock` and
`multiclock_why`.

spec.yaml names which wrapper module to prep (`formal: {top}`, default
`<top>_formal`), how deep to look, and which requirements that wrapper must
prove (`check: formal|both` requirements each carry a `property:` label
matching an assert's own Verilog statement label in formal/*.sv).

Depth comes from the design, never from this gate: `formal: {depth: N}` is
required. A MISSING one is a finding, formal_depth_missing (an error, so
the gate fails and nothing runs): the property-writer owns setting it, and
a refusal would give the fix loop no work order to route there (a spec
written before depth was required was stuck with no legal fix). A present
but non-positive or malformed one is still refused (formal_settings).
`depth` is the PROVE depth only - the k of smt's k-induction and pdr's run -
so it should be what the asserts need for induction to close, which is
usually small: k-induction proves unboundedly, it does not have to walk a
long window. A deep `depth` makes smt's basecase infeasible (each step
costs seconds, so a ~1100-step basecase never finishes within the gate).
The long reach - a measurement window, a full frame, a counter wrap - goes
in `formal: {cover_depth: M}` (optional, M >= N), which only the cover task
uses. A shallow `depth` is never a loophole: an assert whose induction does
not close at it is still reported bounded, never proven.
`formal: {timeout_s: T}` (optional, at most TIMEOUT_MAX_S) sets every sby
task's timeout, which otherwise scales with that task's depth.

Three sby TASKS, same model; smt and pdr at `depth`, cov at `cover_depth`:
  smt  mode prove, engine smtbmc yices  - k-induction: a PASSING basecase
       AND a passing induction step together are a full, unbounded proof.
       Per-property basecase/induction status comes from smtbmc's own
       stdout ("returned pass/FAIL for basecase/induction" - sby has no
       per-property breakdown of THIS, only of which property failed, so a
       property that fails do so together at the task level; see
       _parse_task_status).
  pdr  mode prove, engine abc pdr        - the second opinion (gates.yaml:
       "abc pdr as the second opinion"). PDR gives no per-property
       breakdown at all (proved empirically: its own XML collapses every
       property into one "default" testcase) - only a design-level
       PASS/FAIL, applied to every property as corroboration. A pdr
       task whose DONE is ERROR only because yosys-witness crashed
       converting abc's counterexample to a trace still counts as FAIL
       (pdr_done_status).
  cov  mode cover, engine smtbmc yices   - "every cover reached": a COVER
       testcase with no <failure> in THIS task's XML was reached; one that
       IS present but not reached carries a <failure> here (proved
       empirically: an intentionally-unreachable cover comes back
       DONE(FAIL) with the specific COVER testcase failing, not the
       ASSERT ones, which the cover task never evaluates - they're
       <skipped> there instead). An unreached cover is an error
       cover_not_reached naming the depth and telling the fixer to raise
       formal.cover_depth, never the prove depth.
       The same task also covers every ASSERT (`chformal -assert2cover`,
       which keeps the assert's own id): a cover that is not reached means
       no trace within `cover_depth` ever enables that assert - see
       vacuous below.

Per-property (ASSERT-kind) verdict, applied per `property:` label:
  proven   smt task's own testcase has no <failure> AND smt's basecase AND
           induction both report "pass" AND the pdr task's own DONE is PASS.
  bounded  smt's basecase reports "pass" (no counterexample within `depth`
           steps) but induction did not (an inconclusive/unproven induction
           step, not a counterexample - sby also puts a <failure> on the
           property whose induction step failed, with trace_induct.vcd,
           and that is still bounded, never failed). Recorded with `depth` - "the
           gate never reports it as proven" (docs/design.md section 2) -
           a severity "info" finding, visible but never counted toward the
           gate's fail_severities: bounded to the spec's own asked depth is
           this gate's OWN passing outcome, just never claimed as a proof.
  failed   this property's own testcase carries a <failure> in the smt
           task and smt's basecase did not pass, OR the pdr task's overall DONE is FAIL while smt did not
           already fail it (an engine disagreement - PDR is a sound method
           for a safety property, so a PDR counterexample the k-induction
           run did not also find is treated as a real failure, not
           dismissed).
  vacuous  smt/pdr passed it (proven or bounded), but the cov task never
           reached it as a cover: no trace within `cover_depth` enables the
           assert (an `assume` or a gate condition rules out every state it
           checks, or the assumptions contradict each other). An error
           vacuous_pass - a vacuous pass never reads as a pass.

Async self-reset loops. A tri-state PFD's classic `AND(up, dn)` async clear
(both flops cleared the instant they are both set) is correct in sim and in
holdout, but under `multiclock on` sby's own clk2fflogic turns it into a
combinational loop - the clear depends combinationally on the very flops it
clears - and the smt2 step refuses with "Found logic loop in module X"
before any property is even attempted. Rewriting the RTL with an `` ifdef
FORMAL `` to break that loop is not this gate's route (docs/design.md says
why): the loop is cut in the FORMAL MODEL ONLY, never in rtl/ or
formal/*.sv, and only when spec.yaml's `formal.async_reset_cuts` names the
exact instance. Each entry is `{signal, why}` - `signal` the flop's own Q
net, dotted the same way a hierarchical reference already is elsewhere in
this file (`dut.up`), `why` the reason a human wrote down (async_reset_cuts,
never inferred from the netlist). Before sby ever runs, build_cut_il preps,
flattens and `dffunmap`s the design once, then cut_async_reset_nets
text-edits the resulting RTLIL (a real net-level edit, inspectable in
`log/formal/cut.il`, never a synthesis directive). What it abstracts is
the loop's feedback and nothing else: inside each declared flop's ARST
cone, every declared flop's Q is replaced by that flop's PRE-RESET value -
the value clk2fflogic gives it before this step's async reset, built from
the previous step's Q, D and ARST (one `$ff` each) and the clock edge - and
only the cone cells on a path from a declared Q are copied. Every other
ARST input (an external `~rst_n`) still reaches ARST in the same step, so
a reset requirement is scored exactly as the RTL has it, and the clear
still lands in the very step the second flop sets, so "never both high"
holds as it does in zero-delay sim once the clear has settled. What the
model cannot show is the delta-cycle glitch itself (both flops briefly
both-set before the clear catches up) and the reset pulse's width - sim's
job, never formal's. The PRE value copies clk2fflogic's own $adff model
(yosys 0.69), so each cut also carries a self-check assert
(`<signal>$async_cut_matches_clk2fflogic`) that the flop's real Q is the
cut ARST applied to PRE from step 1 on; a counterexample to it, or sby
never reporting it, is refused (check_cut_model) - a yosys that models
the flop differently can never pass through a stale cut. Only a plain
async-reset flop (`$adff`, or `$adffe` once `dffunmap` has split off its
enable) is covered; a `signal` that resolves to another async cell
($dffsr, $dlatch, ...) or to nothing at all, an ARST cone that reads a
part-select or concatenation, passes through a cell this gate does not
copy, or reads no declared Q at all (the declaration cuts nothing), is
refused (async_reset_cut_signal), same as a loop nobody declared (see
below). The report carries `async_reset_cuts` (the applied entries) and,
when any were applied, `async_reset_cuts_note` saying the above, and each
applied cut is also an info finding (async_reset_cut_applied), so a pass
resting on a cut never reads as an unqualified pass.

Refuses (CheckError, never a pass) rather than reports a finding when: no
requirement in spec.yaml has check: formal|both (an empty property set -
docs/design.md section 2's own silent-failure concern, applied here: a
formal gate with nothing to prove is not vacuously clean, it never ran);
a `property:` label spec.yaml names is not found as an ASSERT testcase in
sby's own model (the id sby echoes back, not a text search - a rename, or
under slang an immediate assert outside a named block, leaves the id
missing); a label that matches two ids; formal.depth missing or not a
positive int (a missing one is the formal_depth_missing finding, not a
refusal), or cover_depth/timeout_s/multiclock malformed (see Depth above); `multiclock: false` on a design that needs it (see Clocks above);
slang needed but unavailable or
unable to read the design (see Frontend above); any sby task fails to reach a DONE line at all (a crashed
launcher, a solver missing, a syntax error before the model even builds);
formal.async_reset_cuts is malformed, names a signal that is not a plain
async-reset flop's Q, has an ARST cone the cut cannot rebuild, has a
self-check assert that fails or never ran (check_cut_model), or a task's own log shows "Found logic loop" in a
module and no cut was declared for it (async_reset_cut_signal /
async_reset_loop_undeclared - see Async self-reset loops above).

    (see build_cut_il) so no declared flop's own Q - nor any other declared
    Q - reaches a declared flop's ARST combinationally. Each declared
    `signal` gets a PRE-RESET copy (`<signal>$async_pre`, built below from
    `$ff`s of the previous step's Q, D and cut ARST plus the clock edge,
    the way clk2fflogic models the flop). Each declared flop's ARST cone -
    the combinational cells (CUT_COMB_CELLS) and module-level `connect`
    aliases behind its ARST net - is rebuilt as a copy (`<net>$async_cut`)
    reading that PRE copy wherever the original read a declared Q; only the
    cells on a path from a declared Q are copied, so every other ARST input
    (an external `~rst_n`) still reaches ARST in the same step, and the
    original cone still drives everything else it drove. Each cut also gets
    a `$assert` named `<signal>` + ASYNC_CUT_CHECK_SUFFIX that, from step 1
    on, the flop's Q is the cut ARST applied to PRE (check_cut_model reads
    it). A real net-level edit, never a synthesis directive.

    Refuses (CheckError) rather than guess: a `signal` that is no cell's
    whole Q, or a cell other than $adff (ASYNC_CUT_CELL_TYPES), or one
    whose CLK/D/polarity/reset value it cannot read; an
    ARST cone that reads a part-select or concatenation, passes through a
    cell outside CUT_COMB_CELLS, or loops combinationally on its own; and
    an ARST cone that reads no declared Q at all (the declaration cuts
    nothing, so it is not the loop it claims to be). Pure (no I/O, no
    yosys) so the edit is testable without sby."""
