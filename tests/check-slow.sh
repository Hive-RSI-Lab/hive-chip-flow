# CLAUDE.md keeps tests/check.sh under two minutes and this set alone ran
# past that once M3's formal/cover/synth suites landed. Not wired into
# tests/check.sh - run this one by hand, or from a slower CI lane.

# The cap catches a hang, not a slow box: M1-M3's own marked set (mutate is
# the slowest single gate there, ~20-25 s per run, several times over)
# measured ~146 s of wall time under load (uptime 20-30 on 6 cores). M4
# added one real end-to-end proof (test_check_harden.py's
# test_harden_job_killed_halfway_..., two full real LibreLane harden runs
# plus five real signoff gates) that alone measured ~815 s under load - the
# old 900 s cap left the rest of the slow set almost no room and one busy
# box away from a false-red timeout kill, not a real hang. Tests also
# marked `harden_faults` (whole corpus rungs, several top hardens each) run
# in tests/check-harden-faults.sh instead, so they never eat this cap.
# Scratch in memory and fsync off: tests/lib/scratch.sh.
