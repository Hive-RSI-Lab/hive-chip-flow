# chip-flow

Claude Code skills for designing chips with open tools: `/vde` for digital blocks in Verilog, `/ade` for analog
blocks, and `/msde` for a mixed-signal task that drives the other two. Each takes a task wherever a project stands,
and every result has to pass gates that are hard to fool: lint, simulation, formal proof, hardening, timing, DRC,
LVS, SPICE at every corner, and planted faults that each gate must catch.

The skills run end to end today. `/vde` has taken an 8-bit counter through every gate to a release, and a UART and an
SPI peripheral with a FIFO each pass every gate and wait only on their human sign-off, as do a current mirror and an
R2R DAC from `/ade`. The optimise loop cut the UART's area by 30% (3198 to 2249 µm²) over twelve trials, and the
winner still passed holdout, formal and mutation testing (`docs/runs/optimise-uart/`). `evals/ladder.md` scores every
rung, and `docs/design.md` is the plan.

## Checks on GitHub Actions

Every pull request and every push to main runs the jobs in `.github/workflows/checks.yml`, each on a standard runner that unpacks
the same pinned IIC-OSIC-TOOLS image the box uses and runs the tools through `bin/eda`. `tests/check.sh`, the landing
gate, takes about 2 minutes. `tests/check-slow.sh`, the real-tool pytest set, takes about 9 minutes.
`tests/check-harden-faults.sh` runs once per rung whose planted faults need full hardens (vde counter8, msde
dac_tile and sensor_counted); its time isn't measured yet. About 1.5 to 2
minutes of each job goes to pulling the toolchain. To read a run, open it from the Actions tab. The summary page gives
each job's pull time and gate time, and a red job's log ends with the failing check. A failed slow run also keeps its
logs as the `check-slow-logs` artifact for 7 days.
